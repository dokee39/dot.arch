*___Tilde/d_talk_aboutmana d_00
We elves have cells called Glutocruorin in our blood that stores mana and circulates it throughout our body.


*n_01
Elves can convert magic power into energy...that's something I learned in class.



*d_02
Yup. Magic power tends to be drawn towards those with stronger desires for it. 
*
In other words, it's affected by emotions.
*
So, if your <c blue>MP is low when you pluck a magical plant, you'll recover more MP<c>.
*
On the other hand, if your <c blue>MP is already relatively high, the mana is more likely to go to nearby monsters<c>.

*n_03
...Why are you lecturing me on the basics of mana? Are you worried about me?

*d_04
Yeah, so? I don't exactly like the idea of my sister being turned into some monsters' plaything.

*n_05
And yet you bet on me losing yesterday...

*d_06
It's not like I actually wanted you to lose. I was just taking the safe bet, since you're such a klutz.
*
Zeth ended up winning the bet anyway, so it doesn't matter.
*
And it's a win-win situation for all of us if our ever-so-promising brother can earn money and eat good food in the village, right?

*n_07
It'd be nice if you'd do something to make me feel good too...


*d_08
Oh, is that how you feel? I'll keep that in mind if I ever see you in the forest and you're really frustrated.


*n_09
<m pre>That's not what I meant!


// ========================================================
// MARK : cane
// ========================================================

*___Tilde/d_talk_cane d_00
Your staff is essential when fighting monsters. So what are you supposed to do when they pounce on you and knock it away?

*n_01
The staff is attuned to its owner's mana.
It'll come back to me whenever I call for it.

*d_02
Whoa! I didn't know it worked like that. Guess I should've expected the national academy to equip their cadets with only the best stuff.

*n_03
This latest version has something called...'WiFu' technology...I think?
*
If the staff is away from its owner for a long time, there is a built-in function which will request help for the owner.

*d_04
Wow, sounds like it's practically sentient!

*n_05
...but, I have that turned off.

*d_06
How come? Are you okay with monsters carrying you off and never coming back home?

*n_07
It sent an SOS call the other day while I was on the toilet. It was so embarrassing...

*d_08
Isn't that just you being careless?!



// ========================================================
// MARK : cooking
// ========================================================

*___Tilde/d_talk_cooking n_00
What's for breakfast?
*d_01
Toast and fried eggs, as usual. 
*
I'm also gonna pick some oranges and cucumbers from the garden to make jam and pickles.

*n_02
I don't like pickles...


*d_03
Beastmen really are picky, huh... Try to see it from my perspective and you'll understand.

*n_04
Thank you for everything you do.


*d_05
Well, cooking is fun. And it's not like we have the money to hire a maid.

*n_06
Y'know...it's been in my mind for a while now, and...I want to try cooking too.


*d_07
Ha? No freakin' way. 
I bet 100G you cut your fingers off.

*n_08
<m ple>I-I may be clumsy...but I think I can manage cooking something simple!

*d_09
Hmm~ Where does that curiosity of yours come from...


// ========================================================
// MARK : cooking2
// ========================================================

*___Tilde/d_talk_cooking2 d_00
Eating food will give you some pretty good buffs. Automatic HP recovery, or a huge increase in attack power for example.
*
So unless you're in heat and only stepping out to fool around with the monsters, you should eat before leaving.

*n_01
As if that'd ever be the reason I go out!

*d_02
The potency and duration of the buff is affected by the quality and quantity of ingredients used in each recipe.
*
Whenever you fight a monster, the buff's duration will decrease. It's a good idea to come home when the buff runs out and you're hungry again.

*n_03
Can't you just pack me a lunch so I can eat outside?

*d_04
Food spoils instantly when it comes in contact with mana fog. So unless you have a <c blue>special container<c>, you have to eat at home. 
*d_05
Our shop does sell them, but they're expensive. And you know what our sister's stance is on family discounts...
*d_06
You'll have to work hard and save up if you want the luxury of eating on the go.




// ========================================================
// MARK : cooking3
// ========================================================



*___Tilde/d_talk_cooking3 n_00
I want to try cooking!

*d_01
No.
*n_02
Why nooooot!


*d_03
Because this is my kitchen, my ingredients from the garden, and my good seasonings. I am deeply attached to them. 
*
Got it? If you were to burn any of them you would no longer be a sister to me.

*n_04
Uuu...

*d_05
I do still have a stock of ingredients that I bought from town, but even those are off limits.

*
If you really want to try cooking, you'll have to gather your own ingredients.

*n_06
Oh, I can do that! I'm good at gathering.

*d_07
You can use the regular cookware, but don't even think about laying a finger on Josephine.

*n_08
...You named your frying pan?


*d_09
Isn't she cute? It's a pan of love, coated in the oils of countless meals. It took years to get her to this state...

*n_10
<think>Now that I think about it, that's the same pan he's been using since he graduated...


*d_11
Here, you can cook with this until you prove you're capable of handling something more advanced.

*n_12
Wow, thank you so much! I'll take good care of it.

*d_13
Let's start by having you cook the toast I mentioned earlier.
*
I'll provide the ingredients for today, but after this you'll have to use ones you've gathered yourself.


*d_14
...We've already gone over this.
*
I'll let you use some of my ingredients, but I'm keeping the finished sandwich this time. Try not to mess it up.

// ========================================================
// MARK : ___Tilde/cook_tuto00
// ========================================================


*___Tilde/cook_tuto00 d_00
First, select a recipe.
We'll start with the most basic thing, bread.
*
Your known recipes will show up in this list. Now, select 'bread' and get ready to cook!

*d_02
<W2/>The box in the top-left lists all the ingredients you need for the selected recipe.

*d_03
This top line shows the minimum required and maximum allowed for this ingredient in the recipe.

*
Move the cursor with <key ta/> and select this ingredient.


*d_04
Ok, we have the wheat required.
Use <key submit/> to add in at least two of them.


*n_05
Is it okay to put in all five of them?

*d_06
Do you actually plan on eating that much? What a glutton you are.

*n_07
N-No, I was just asking!

*d_08
Now we need some water. Add it in the same way.


*d_10
You will see details of the finished product in the box below.
*
This fork and knife symbol represents how filling the food is. The bar represents your stomach capacity.
*
The more ingredients you add to each dish, the more filling it will be. 
*
It's in your best interest to eat until you're full, so plan ahead when preparing each meal.
*
Some ingredients have special effects when eaten.
*
Wheat helps keep mana neutral. Neutral mana is easier to recover after it scatters.
*
If mana neutrality is low, it could lead to a situation where monsters absorb all the scattered mana and become huge.
*d_11
The strength of each ingredient's effect that will shine through in the finished product is displayed on the right side (Pow).
*
The food will be more filling if you add more than the minimum amount, but you won't be getting the most out of each ingredient.
*
In short, don't crowd your dish with too many distinct or powerful flavors. Allow yourself the chance to savor them.
*d_12
This is starting to drag on a bit.
Move your cursor down to that button and let's start cooking.


*d_13
Not half bad for your first attempt at baking bread.


// ========================================================
// MARK : ___Tilde/cook_tuto01
// ========================================================



*___Tilde/cook_tuto01 n_00
So this...is cooking!

*d_01
Well, the kitchen's still intact. I'd say that's a job well done.

*n_02
What do you take me for!?

*n_03
It looks so delicious...well then, let's dig in-

*d_04
<I>Whoa, whoa, hold up!
You're not seriously going to eat just bread, are you!?


*n_05
Why not? It's still hot and fresh...

*d_06
Yeah, but did you even consider putting in some veggies?
You need to add more flavor and nutrition to your meal.

*n_07
I suppose so...
Freshly baked bread is good all on its own though...

*d_08
Sigh. Next, we're going to learn how to make a sandwich.



// ========================================================
// MARK : ___Tilde/cook_tuto02
// ========================================================

*___Tilde/cook_tuto02 d_00
This time, pick 'Sandwich' from the recipe list.

*d_01
<W2>For a sandwich, you need two pieces of bread.　It would be a bit of a hassle if you had to make them separately each time, right?
*
When a recipe uses another dish as an ingredient, you can make them at the same time as the recipe that calls for them if you've made them previously.
*
Move your cursor to the bread,
then press <key add/>.


*d_03
<W2>You can choose the approximate quality of the ingredients to use with this menu. 
Customize them to your liking.
*d_04
This will cook a new bread to use in addition to the one you made previously.
*
With that, the bread is ready.
*d_05
The second line tells you to put in 2-4 'fruit' or 'vegetables'.
*
You can mix and match them as you please.
*
But remember that adding more than the minimum amount (2) will have diminishing returns for the special effects. 


*d_06
Now that the ingredients are prepared, you are ready to cook. Select 'Start cooking' in the box below.

*d_07
OK. That should be filling enough to tide you over until evening.
*
That's the basics of cooking. I can explain it to you again if you ever need me to, but it's better to learn by doing.

// ========================================================
// MARK : ___Tilde/cook_tuto03
// ========================================================




*___Tilde/cook_tuto03 d_00
I'll say it again because it's extremely important: You cannot generally bring food outside of the house.
*
If you fight outside even once, all the food you have on hand will spoil due to exposure to magic.
*
You won't gain anything from eating spoiled food, so store it or eat before you go out.


*n_01
What should I do if I get hungry out there?


*d_02
Just come back home and eat. 
*
Or buy one of those special lunch boxes that can prevent magic from spoiling your food.


*n_03
Um...
Can I ask one more thing?

*d_04
What is it?

*n_05
Can I eat this sandwich now, while it's fresh...?

*d_06
Sigh...you glutton. 
Sure, go ahead. Enjoy.

// ========================================================
// MARK : ___Tilde/d_talk_stomach
// ========================================================

*___Tilde/d_talk_stomach d_00
By now you should know that each ingredient can have various benefits when cooked and eaten.

*n_01
If I cook and eat a lot of food with a variety of effects, will I become the strongest...?

*d_02
That depends on your cooking skills. Just be careful not to eat too much.
*
If you try to eat a high value dish when you are already full, only a little will actually go down your stomach.
*
That means the potency of the dish will be greatly reduced.

*n_03
Can't I just store the leftovers? 
Or maybe, combine them with other dishes...


*d_04
...Disgraceful. If I were father I'd disown you.

*d_05
By the way, <c blue>the effect of all food eaten when you are hungry will be 1.5 times greater</c>.
*
Food tastes a lot better when you are hungry, after all.
*
Because of that, your first meal of the day should be a special one made with high-grade ingredients.

Isn’t it? 
I was looking for a place like this to relax after school. 
This spot seemed perfect.

By the way, why’d you bring your cookware all the way out here?
