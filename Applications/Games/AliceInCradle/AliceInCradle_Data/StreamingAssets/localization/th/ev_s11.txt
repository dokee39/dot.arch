// s11 イクシャを探す最中外出時に沼に遭遇した



*s11_swamp n_00
There's a lot of small, magic-resistant monsters here...attacking them is useless.
*n_01
They're all over the ceiling, too...I'll have to be careful to not jump into them.

*n_02
If I need extra hang time or distance after jumping, I can <c blue>dodge in mid-air<c>.

Ah, um...y-yes.

Wow! This must be one of the "WiFu" features...
*
The secondhand staff I was using until two weeks ago didn't have anything like this! I can't believe it understands and responds to my voice...
*n_05_2
Umm...can you please tell me more about the distress signal.

*n_07
That's Ixia...!
I have to go save her quickly...!

*n_08
The nearby device I sent the distress signal to probably belongs to that guard back home... 
*
I don't think he'll be coming...

*n_09
I should mark the position of the distress signal on my map. Let's see, it should be right about...here...

*n_10
Ixia, please be safe...!

<m scary>A-ah, no... 
<m fadein>don't hurt me... 
*
<m scary>ugh... 
<m joy>ohh...!

*n_03
<m ple>Ixia!

*i_04
Noel Cor...<m scary>Ah, no,
<m fadein>not my nipples─

*n_05
Awawa...Hang on!
I'm here to help!




*s11_2a_2 i_00
<angry><m scary>Oof!

*n_01
Kya!

*i_02
<m fadein>Uuu...now I'll never get to be a bride...


*n_03
S-Stay strong!

*i_04
...That thing is still hiding underground! 
Come on, Noel, we have to fight it!

*n_05
Ixia, you're in no condition to fight! Rest up, I'll deal with the monster.

*i_06
No, I can still help! Besides, if you fight it head-on, you'll probably end up like me.
*
It's faster than it looks and its senses are sharp enough for it to reflect our spells. But, maybe there's a way we can trick it?
*
I don't think it can tell exactly what's happening above ground while it's burrowing.
*
Try <c blue>placing a bomb before the monster emerges and luring it in<c>.




*s11_3a i_use_bomb
Use a bomb!

// ボム食わせ成功時

Now's our chance!

This...can't be...



*s11_4a n_00
Haa..haa...

*i_01
T-Thank you. 
I would expect nothing less from my rival...
*n_02
Ixia... 
let's get you cleaned up.


*i_03
You really saved me this time, Noel Cornehl.
*
I was wrapped up so tight I couldn't even move. I didn't know what was going to happen for a moment there.

*n_04
How are you feeling? It must've absorbed a lot of your mana...

*i_05
Oh, don't worry about that. My mana storing abilities are second to none!
*
My body won't break down like yours did even with twice as much damage to my blood!


*n_06
Hey, I'm not that weak...

*i_07
Yeah, I know. I shouldn't discredit you after you helped me. This is supposed to be a thank you after all...

*i_08
Anyway, I brought you a spell. Make good use of it!





*s11_5a i_00
It's rather large and easily blocked by terrain. But, there's a function that lets you control it to compensate!


*n_01
Is it the same spell you used in the battle a moment ago?
*i_02
Indeed! Its power and versatility are awe-striking! For example...


*s11_5b_2 i_00
See that switch hanging above the pit?
*
Fire the energy ball into the opening, then use <key ta/> to redirect it upwards!
