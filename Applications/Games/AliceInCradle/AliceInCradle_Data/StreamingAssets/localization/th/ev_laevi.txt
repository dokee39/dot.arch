// ========================================================



*___Laevi/v_talk_homeroad v_00
Other than the monster encounter, how was your walk back home yesterday? See anything interesting?

*n_01
Part of the bridge by the front gate is starting to sink into the thorns. I don't think it's dangerous yet though...

*v_02
Y'know, I planted those thorns because I thought they'd create a fitting vibe for a witch's shop.
*
Now that they've grown wild and thick, I can see that wasn't the best idea. 
*
I wonder if we could use magic to get them under control~

*n_03
Magenta thorns have something in them that disperses mana. The few basic spells we know probably wouldn't work at all.

*v_04
Yeah, I suppose not.
Wait, a minute...
*v_05
...does that mean there's an extra layer of pain when I use my thorn whip on my customers~!?

*n_05
It doesn't affect the mana in our blood, from what I learned.
...do you actually do things like that?

*v_06
Oh, are you interested? Would you rather give the whippings or receive them~?

*n_07
Neither!!




*___Laevi/v_talk_forestroad v_00
I'd like to make the path between our shop and the elf village a little safer to traverse.

*n_01
Don't you already spray it with herbicides to keep mana plants from growing?

// ※レヴィが撒いている
*v_02
Yes, with some help from the guards. It doesn't seem to be enough to keep the monsters away though...
*
Which reminds me, have they done anything about that big one yet?


// ※シナリオの進み（s10 で衛兵のイベントを見ているかどうか）で2パターンの回答～～
*n_03
No, I don't think it's been dealt with.

*n_04
No, it's still lurking around somewhere.


// ～～ここまで

*v_05
Hmm, I see~
Our store has the thrills and the monster provides the chills! Sounds kinda cool, but... 
*
It's not fun if the danger is life-threatening. I'd like to keep it at a moderate level, like with choke play.

*n_06
Isn't that still pretty dangerous...?







*___Laevi/v_talk_village v_00
Just once, I'd like to be able to visit the elf village.

*n_01
You can see it from here when the fog is thin.

*v_02
Ah, yes~ and what a sight it is to behold. A floating city above the forest!

*v_03
Unfortunately, we are the exiled Cornehl family...boo-hoo~

*n_03
Yeah, only our father and big brother Zeth are allowed in...

*v_04
I wish I were as smart as Zeth. He had the top score for his entrance exam!
*
With a title and aura like his, I could waltz right past the gatekeeper.


*n_05
I-I think you're great as you are! The village people may not approve of you, but...

*v_06
I know that! I'm cute and awesome~!
*
I'll play to my strengths and get into the village my own way.
*
Maybe I could find a distinguished elven gentlemen to be my sugar daddy or something?

*n_07
Is being promiscuous really enough to get by on...?






*___Laevi/v_talk_mtr_quality n_00
Do you have any tips on gathering materials?


*v_01
Oho~, are you going to gather materials for me again? <m joy>You're such a good girl, Noel!<m> *pat* *pat*

// 撫でられる
*n_02
Wah, there are customers here...


// これから実装するシステムの話
*v_03
By now you probably know that most spots where you can get materials will be replenished after you return home.
*
But, did you know you're more likely to find <c red>higher quality materials<c> when the <c blue>danger level<c> is also high~?

*n_04
Danger...


*v_05
Yep. As you defeat individual monsters, their scattered mana will start to build up...
*
...and once you finally finish the whole group... 

*v_06
<m joy>SPLURT~<m> their pent up mana will gush forth, increasing the danger level and improving the quality of nearby materials~!

*n_06 
Y-You don't need to use such an obscene analogy every time...

*v_07
You're so naive~




*___Laevi/v_talk_dangerousness v_00
As I said, the danger level of an area will increase as you defeat groups of monsters. 
*
You can re-fight groups as much as you like, but the rewards will only drop once.




*v_01
Monsters will be stronger and attack in greater numbers at high danger levels. 
*
They'll also be much more aggressive and might ambush you even if you haven't touched a mana plant.

*v_02
So don't stay out too late. But, for the satisfaction of our customers, try edging as close to nightfall as possible~!

*n_03
Edging...I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Anyway, you're saying I should come back at a reasonable hour?

*v_04
That's right~ Just promise me you'll be extra careful if you do decide to stay out after dark.

*v_05
Oh, one more thing! When the danger level is low, you can warp between benches you've already sat down on!

*v_06
If the danger level rises, you'll have to walk. However, <c blue>you can always return home from any bench<c>~



*___Laevi/v_talk_battle_reward v_00
When you defeat a group of monsters, you'll be rewarded with a treasure chest of materials. You don't have to open it right away.

*n_01
So...just hold on to it?

*v_02
Of course, they'll take up space in your inventory, so you can't have an unlimited number of them.
*
Also, since you can't use the items inside until you open them, having too many will make exploring tricky~.

*v_03
Also also, <c blue>the item quality is affected by the danger level when you open the chest<c>, not when you obtain it.
*
Which means...fufufu~


*v_04
If you get some chests and knock out a few monsters first...

*n_05
I'll get higher quality items...?
*v_06
Correct! Delay your gratification and let it build up first. That always feels best~!

*n_07
Ooh, so I could store a lot of chests at home, then take them with me and increase the danger level...!

*v_08
Ah~ afraid it doesn't work that way.
When you return home all chests will automatically be opened.
*
The same happens if you faint, but <c red>the danger level resets to zero first<c>.

*v_09
Other items in your bag won't be lost when you faint, so it might be wise to open the chests if you think you won't make it~.




*___Laevi/v_talk_weather v_00
I've heard interesting things can happen when the weather changes.

*v_01
Like when it's <c blue>'Foggy'<c>, it is easier for both you and the monsters to accumulate mana.

*v_02
And contaminated monsters can suddenly appear during <c blue>'Thunder'<c>~! Isn't that exciting~?

*n_03
Uu...I've heard stories about them...they sound really scary...

*v_04
<m joy>Scary and cool~!<m> Monsters need to absorb mana to survive, but if they gorge themselves on it they mutate or something... 
*
Too much of a good thing, I guess~

// ========================================================
// MARK : pvv102 関連
// ========================================================




*___Laevi/v_talk_pvv102_quake v_00
Welcome back, Noel. Do you know what caused that loud noise a moment ago?

*n_01
Some large monsters are rampaging through the forest. Sounds like they're really close by...

*v_02
I see. Thankfully we've got protective barriers around the house. Maybe you should stay here where it's safe today.

*n_03
But, Ixia might be in danger! If she is...I have to help her!


*v_04
Noel, I understand how you feel, but we're not trained to handle these situations. And you're still an just an apprentice cadet.
*
The smartest choice would be to leave this to the adults.

*n_05
...This is something I have to do. I want to be the kind of person who can help others when they need it most...
*
Just like the time we were attacked while exploring the forest and you saved me...

*v_06
Hmm...I don't remember ever doing anything like that. Are you sure it was me~?

*n_07
<I>It's my most treasured memory!


*v_08
Oh well, no matter~ If that's how you feel, go right ahead!

*n_09
That was a quick turnaround!

*v_10
Well, history has shown that once Noel makes up her mind about something, there's no stopping her. 
*
Considering what happened two weeks ago, I'm amazed you're so eager to jump into the fray~



*n_11
I-I'll do my best to not let that happen again...!

*v_12
In that case, make sure you come back before dark to avoid stronger packs of monsters.



*n_13 
<think>I should check with her again to make sure I understand the dangers of staying out too late...



*___Laevi/v_talk_pvv102_memory v_00
Ah, it's hazy, but I'm starting to remember now~ I told you not to explore any deeper, but you didn't listen.

*n_01
Sorry for all the trouble I caused you back then...

*v_02
You've always been stubborn, Noel. You just couldn't deny your curiosity, could you?



*n_03
Uu...so embarrassing. But, your protective spell helped me discover who I want to be.

*v_04
Spell? I'm not licensed to cast magic, so that's probably not what I used.


*n_05
Eh?

*v_06
You see, back then I was very attractive. People just couldn't keep their hands off me~
*
Every so often, some brazen older gentlemen would try to do something inappropriate. 
*v_07
So to defend myself, I carried capsules that would explode when thrown. BOOM~!
* 
They contained a mana-damaging drug strong enough to daze an elf. It worked on monsters too, since they're basically made of mana.

*n_07
I had no idea... Alchemy and magic were indistinguishable to me back then. But, all that matters is that you saved me.

*v_08
I didn't have a permit for alchemy at the time either. 
*
If I had been caught, I would've gotten in trouble for both illegal possession and synthesizing.
*
Oops, keep that a secret from dad and the guards, will you~?

*n_09
O-okay...




*___Laevi/v_talk_pvv102_sell v_00
Before you head out to help Ixia, you should make sure you're prepared for battle~

*v_01
I'd be happy to sell you something as long as it's in stock, but unfortunately there is no family discount here at the Cornehl shop~

*n_02
W-what if I said "please"?


*v_03
No can do even for you, little sis~ Dad put me in charge of managing the family finances, and our budget is tight.






*___House/_portal_alchemy n_00
Big sister's alchemy pot.
She always adds the ingredients in a rather haphazard way...
*
But, surprisingly, she always produces something wonderful.
*
...I'm sure there's a recipe for beginners somewhere in this room that my sister used when she was little.

*n_01
I wonder if I'm ready to try alchemy... Perhaps I should practice by learning to cook in the kitchen first.

Ah, there it is! <c red>Level 4 Alchemy for Beginners:

*n_02
It's so dusty...
I'm sure sister won't mind if I borrow it. I'll tell her later...

<m fadein>Who's the little brat rummaging around my workshop?

*n_03
<m ple>Yipe!?


*v_04
<m joy>WHO, I ASK!?

*n_05
<m scary>WAAH!

*n_06
<m ple>S...Sister!
</m>Don't scare me like that!

*v_07
<m joy>Oh?<m> Playing the victim after stealing my belongings?
Perhaps a little scare wasn't enough of a punishment.

*n_08
W-well...you see...

*n_09
Sorry...I just wanted to learn more about alchemy.

*v_09
Relax, I was joking.

*v_10
Besides, I'm not surprised. It's only natural at your age to be curious about such things.

*n_11
...Please don't talk about it like it's something immoral.

*v_12
Oh, but alchemy is indeed immoral business.

*v_13
Some of the recipes in the book you took require a Level 4 license.
*
If you try to follow one without a license...

*v_14
<I><m ple>You'll be arrested and whipped mercilessly as punishment!

*n_15
<I><m scary>Y-<W3><m>You're just joking again, right?

*v_16
<W2>...<W2>...<W2>.<W2>

*n_17
<I><m scary>I'm sorry-y-y-y-y!
<m ple>I just wanted to look at it, I wasn't going to use i-i-it!!

*v_18
<m joy>Fufufu, so cute.
*v_19
It really is illegal though...
But, maybe there's a loophole we can use.

*v_19_2
...Ah, I know! Here, a gift from me to you.

*n_20
...<c blue>The Alchemist's Field Guide<c>?

*v_21
Indeed.
And with that...

*v_22
<m ple>Ta-dah!
<m joy>I hereby appoint you as my apprentice. You are now an assistant to a Class-1 alchemist!

*n_23
Really?

*v_24
That book functions as license to practice alchemy.
It's registered under my name, but...

*v_25
...if you're holding it, it'll allow you to freely use the alchemy pot.
It works just like magic~.

*n_26
As an assistant, that means I'll only be using the alchemy pot under your supervision, right?

*v_27
<m ple>Right! That's what I meant~!
<m>But, that's just to keep up appearances...

*v_28
You can do as much alchemy as you want even if I'm not here.

*v_29
Officers of the Alchemy Association don't do on-site inspections that often.

*v_30
As long as you're not synthesizing explosives and setting them off in the city, you won't get arrested.

*n_31
W-well, I still don't feel comfortable with the questionable legality of all this.

*v_32
Ahh, that's my Noel! So pure and innocent~!

*n_33
<I>Wa...
<m ple>Where are you touching!?

*v_34
One more thing-

*v_35
That book is more than just a field guide.

*v_36
It also records and catalogues your adventures.

*n_37
Hmm...

*v_38
Any items you find or enemies you meet will also be recorded, along with all their information. This book can do it all!

*v_39
Check the Important Items tab in the Item menu and select <c blue>Field Guide<c> to open it.

*v_40
You can also check Treasure Chest reels and items available in shops from it.

*v_41
It's pretty useful. Give it a look whenever you can~.

It might be a good idea to make your debut in The Break Room...
