*s12_1a i_00
Good job! As expected from my rivah-ahchoo!

*n_01
You alright? I think you should go back to the academy and take a nice, hot shower...

*i_02
I was already planning to! You don't have to tell me!
*
Anyway, the <c blue>Energy Ball should be useful for fighting any fast enemies<c> you encounter in the giant trees ahead!
*
Just be careful not to get your mana absorbed like mine was!

*n_03
Got it. Thank you for everything, Ixia.
*i_04
Don't thank me just yet, Noel Cornehl! After all...

*i_05
I still have one more spell to give you!

*n_05
!?

*i_06
It's one that's particularly good for self-defense; perfect for you!  
*
I'll try to deliver it to you before the big ones start running wild!


*n_07
Won't that be kind of...troublesome? You could just hold onto it until we meet agai─

*i_08
Aaanyway, you'll be climbing up the giant tree and trudging through the school route into town later, no?
*
We'll definitely meet up along the way!

*i_09
See you later, Noel Cornehl!

// 飛んでいく
*n_09
...And off she goes. 
I hope she'll be alright.
*n_10
So... 
I can <c blue>use the Energy Ball to counter the upcoming quick enemies<c>. I'll keep that in mind.

*s12_mepha x_00
The drawbridge to the village is currently closed.
*
There have been reports of big monster sightings at the mansion overlooking the lake.
*
We'll open the drawbridge as soon we get the all clear signal.
*
There's a tunnel just down this cliff that leads to the <c blue>Giant Acid Tree<c>.
*
Go that way if you're in a hurry.

*x_01
Are you a student in the village? Your uniform looks a bit out of date...
*
It's not safe here. You should take shelter at the hillside mansion.
*
Although, personally I don't like that place. 
*
The employees' sleazy dresses and the gnarled vines everywhere make me uncomfortable...

*x_02
If you keep going ← this way, you'll eventually reach the hills.
*
But if you're in a hurry, <c blue>go down the cliff and find the tunnel that leads to the Giant Acid Tree<c>.  
*
You can keep staring at me all you want, but I'm not lowering the drawbridge.
*
Ever hear the saying 'a watched pot never boils'?

*s12_2a l_00
Cornehl?

*n_01
Oh, you're...Alma, right?
*
<think>Alma, one of my classmates.
She's a quiet girl. We haven't spoken to each other much...

// 2-B 隣に座る =================================
*n_02
...

*l_03
Are you all better?


// 3-A daijoubu =================================
*l_04
That's good to hear...


// => 4-A


// 3-B Nope =================================
// 1日目で敗けていない
*n_05
It still hurts a bit.
*
And sometimes, when I'm fighting, the memories of that day come screaming back...

*l_06
I see...that must be difficult.


// => 4-B

// 3-C Nope =================================
// 1日目で敗けていた場合
*n_07
It still hurts a bit.
*
And...the other day...I was attacked again and got badly hurt.
*
...I think I might not be cut out for fighting.

// M 立ち上がる
*l_08
<angry><I>That's not true!

*n_09
...!? Wha-what's the matter?

// M 座りなおす
*l_10
Ah...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.


// => 4-B


// 4-A =================================
// しばらく沈黙
*l_11
...Is it okay if I talk about what happened that day at school?


// => 5-A

// 4-B =================================
// しばらく沈黙
*l_12
...So I shouldn't talk about what happened that day at school, should I?

*n_13
...No no, it's okay. What did you want to say?


// => 5-A


// 5-A =================================

*l_14
When the monster horde attacked Grazia two weeks ago, many of them rushed towards the school...
*
The guards fought the ones that forced their way into the building, but the field our class was in was completely unprotected.
*l_15
...Being the dunce that I am, I tripped and fell when I tried to run away... 
*
I thought for sure I was going to die.
*l_15_2
But then, you cast a spell and knocked the monster down...do you remember?

*n_15
Of course...but I didn't knock it down. At most I made it flinch.
*n_16
Which just made them target me...and we both know how that ended.
*n_16_2
But I'm glad you got away safely. That might be the best news I've heard all day.

*l_16
Yeah...it was all thanks to you. But...
*l_16_2
I wasn't able to help you in return. 
I'm so sorry.
*l_16_3
<m scary>All I did was watch as you were engulfed by that black mass....
*
I was so scared...but...I should've done something!

*n_17
You have nothing to apologize for, Alma. 
*
The teachers said there were a ton of monsters in that raid they'd never seen before. There was nothing you could have done.
*n_17_2
And, you see, the Cornehl family is a family of outcasts...I was an unwanted extra in the class.
*
So if I needed to take the attack for everyone else to be spared...that's a burden I was willing to bear─

*l_18
I-It doesn't matter what bloodline you're from! I don't know what those noble-born students think of you, but...
*l_18_2
To me you're a hero.
*l_18_3
What you did was inspiring...

*n_19
...

*l_20
I felt so bad I wasn't able to protect you...
*
I've never liked magic class, but since then I've been secretly training at home.

*n_21
...I see. That means we're rivals from now on.

*l_22
<I><m ple>No, no, not at all!
<m>There's no way I could compete with Cornehl or Polystachya!
*l_22_2
...I may never get to be the person I aspire to be, but I can at least make the effort.
*l_22_3
...Ehehe, sorry for rambling on there.

*n_23
It's alright, it was nice talking to you.　Also, you can just call me 'Noel'.

*l_24
<m fadein>R-Really?
<m>Okay then, Noel.

*l_24_2
Calling each other by our first name makes it feel like we're friends now.

*n_25
We've always been friends, heehee. Well, I'll see you at school.

*l_26
<m ple>See you!

Looks like nobody is getting through with the road collapsed.
I'll keep waiting, but...I'm getting a little sleepy.
*
I heard they're making progress on removing debris from the other side of the road. Think they can handle a job this big?


// 服が破れてる状態でアルマと話す
*l_01
...Noel, please take it easy. 
Also, you should fix your clothes as soon as possible...there are leering eyes everywhere.










// 同所 他のモブ2 (青年)
*s12_mobo x_00
The giant trees here have hollow cavities large enough for us elves to walk through. We cleared them out to use as passageways, but...

*
The 'Giant Acid Tree' lives up to its name. Its acidic sap drips down and pools into lakes.
*
You won't be able to avoid them if you try to get to the village by any route other than this central road.


*x_01
These are my only good clothes and I need them for job hunting, so I can't risk burning them.
*
That's why I don't want to go through that road with all the acid. 
*
The central road collapsing is a disaster on top of a disaster... 
*
Being late to my interview because of this is probably a valid excuse, r-right?



// ノエルの服が破れてる状態で青年と(何度も)話す
*x_02
Whoa, you look awful.　Did you fall into the acid pools or something?



*x_03
...Uh, you don't really want me to see you like that, do you?


*x_04
I have an interview in town later today. I don't know if I'll make it in time...
*
What I really want to say is, uh...can I actually say it?


*x_05
<angry><m scary>I...your...your breasts and underwear are showing!
*
Stop putting dirty thoughts in my mind!


*x_06
<m scary>Hey! Why do you keep trying to talk to me!? Are you an exhibitionist or something!?
*
Sigh...I'm trying really hard not to get all riled up. I'm just going to stare at you. Okay?


*x_07
...Hmm. Monster bite marks. Those look painful. I'm not into pain.
*
There's a bench over there. You should go patch yourself up.

*x_08
You're aware that you're showing me something indecent, aren't you? Alright then, I'm going to talk about something indecent.
*
My friend has been chanting something like 
<m joy><c blue><rb c="Pitiable">KAWAISOU</rb> IS <rb c="Adorable">KAWAII</rb><c><m>. 
*
He's been collecting girls' fiction where the heroine fights something and gets in a bind.
*
That pervert gets all excited over those. What do you think? 


// 問題ない ～～
*x_09
You think so? I mean, I'm not going to tell him what he can and can't do. I think any hobby is fine as long as it doesn't bother other people.

// おかしい ～～
*x_10
I knew you'd think so. ...Wait, after how many times you've spoken to me dressed like that, is that really what you think?

// 選択肢ここまで ～～

*x_11
Sigh...the road is still impassible. Even if I do make it into town, it won't be in time for the interview...
*
I should just go back to the village, bust a nut, and go back to sleep. What would I jack off to, you ask? You, I guess.
*
...Just kidding. I'll go to the book store and buy some new erotica before I head home.
*
I don't normally talk about stuff like this, even with my closest friends.　Maybe you and I are soul mates.
*
...
*
...No, I'm not hitting on you.
Y'know what, forget I said anything...
*
Let's start again from the top. Ahem.


// ここで会話がループする……ように見せかけて、
// もう一度会話を繰り返し選択肢のフェーズまで話しかけ続ける

*x_15
...You kept talking to me over and over again just for the fun of seeing how I would react when you chose a different option to my question.
*
When I go out into the world, I'm sure I'll come across many more situations like this. Situations where my worth is tested over and over again.
*
Perhaps you spoke to me many times as a way of encouraging me, a person who can't be bothered to go to his interview.
*
...When I think about it, maybe meeting you here wasn't so bad after all.
*
From now on, when I'm going through hard times in my life, I'll remember the encouragement you gave me with your exposed chest and panties...
*
Maybe.


*x_16
Even if the situation feels like a dead end, there's a solution for it hidden somewhere.
*
Just like when you flip the clothes up and reveal the breasts and panties...
*
...
No, just no. That's an awful summary.
*
I know I said this earlier, but I should just go home and jerk off.
*
...I hope we can meet again somewhere. Although next time, I'd be happy if you were dressed a little nicer.
*
...
*
I'm still definitely not hitting on you. Seriously.





*s12_oneesan x_00
The central road is the safest route between the elf village and the city. There is a situation right now, though.
*
Some quick-witted folks are taking a detour to the other side of the road. Is that what you're planning to do?
*
There are some hazardous spots along the way where acid sprays out. Be careful not to get burnt to a crisp.


*x_01
This road is regularly sprayed with herbicides to prevent mana plants from growing on it.
*
I once volunteered to help with the decontamination process...it is very tedious and tiresome work.
*
Once you experience something like that, you really appreciate the hard work and effort put in by the people that do it regularly!






*s12_girl x_00
Nighttime is scary, isn't it?
*
Sometimes monsters will suddenly attack you even when you aren't messing with the mana plants. You have to be prepared for battle anytime.

*x_01
Since the attack 2 weeks ago, there has been an increase in the number of monsters that use lightning spells.
*
Some were wandering around nearby earlier. I got scared and ran away... 
*
If you get hit by lightning magic, you need to stay calm and use your Shield or Shield Bash to block it.
*
They'll warp away if you aim a magic attack at them.
*
<c blue>They'll stop warping if they run out of mana<c>. That's the best time to hit them with a strong attack!
*
...You may be wondering why I don't go defeat them since I know so much about them. I-It's because I'm also out of mana today!




*s12_megane x_00
The road collapsed and we can't get to Grazia.
*
I overslept this morning, so I grabbed my breakfast and ran all the way downhill from the village. 
*
I was in such a rush that I barely nibbled on my toast, but it was still all for nothing!
*
I suppose I could climb up the stairs and go along the tree to reach the other side, but...I'm a bit too tired to head back to the village right now~

*x_01
I heard they called in some kind of...beastmen workers? to help clear the debris. I wonder if they'll be able to clear it all overnight?
*
Might as well say that I can't make it today and just skip class. 
Should I?



*s12_morus n_00
Looks like an ancient device of some kind. I can't read what's written on it.
*
There's a black jewel-like object stuck on top of the flickering lights.
