Whoa, that's an Elf Village healer uniform!

*n_00 
Ah, i-it's...um...

*t_01
Hmm, but it's an old model. Kinda like the ones buried in the back of the closet at my parents' place.
*
What gives? You don't look old enough to be wearing something like that...

*n_01 
I'm a cadet at Bermit Academy. I'm just borrowing this outfit for a bit.

*t_02
Oh, I see. That can only mean one thing... 

*t_03
<m joy>You're cosplaying!</m>
<W2><m ples>Oh man, that really brings out my inner prince's desire to protect you!



*t_04
<m fadein><W2 />Princess, if you walk around here, your shoes will get dirty...!


*n_02
<think>What is this...a mini drama?

*t_05
Oh, but princess, this is a dangerous area where monsters roam wild.
*
Are you by any chance good with magic?

*n_04
<normal>
Um...w-well, I think I'm doing rather well at sc- 
<W2><m scary>KYAA!?


*t_06
<W1><m fadein>Hmm~ There's no doubt. Your boobs, biceps, and thighs...

*
<m fadein>I can feel the mana welling under your skin! Right here... *squish* *squish*

*n_05
<angry><m ple>Please stop groping me!

*t_07
<W2>Oops, excuse me, princess. My inner prince's desires took control of my hands there for a moment.

*n_06
<normal>Y-you are a female elf...aren't you?

*t_08
I am just a wandering...peddler.

*
As an apology, allow me to offer you a discount on the items I've collected throughout my travels.


*n_09
<m fadein>Huh...

*t_09
<m joy>With that said...!
*
Your cute ally on your perilous journey, <m ple>Nightingale's Whimsical Roadside Shop, is open for business~!

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 n_00
So, your name is Nightingale?

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_00
Yup! Isn't it cool? It's not my real name, though.

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_00b
A long time ago, I found a book on mythology while up in the mountains. I named myself after one of the goddesses in it!

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 n_01
A goddess?

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_01
Yup! She's really cool! Even in the middle of a fierce battle between the gods, she stayed true to her beliefs!
*
She healed the injured gods with her power of compassion, whether they were allies or enemies!
*
Ever since then, she became known as 'The White Angel'! What a name to be praised by!


*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_02
I want to be just like her...someone who can show love and compassion to everyone, even their enemies.

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 n_02
Nightingale...do you have any enemies?

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_03
Hmm, I guess...maybe someone who doesn't pay for their stuff?

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 t_04
...Now that I think about it, loving everyone in the world is probably impossible~ 
*
Speaking as an elf, it's important to draw a clear line between insiders and outsiders.

*___Nightingale/t_talk00 n_03
<think>She's a straightforward one...



// ========================================================
// MARK : t_talk01
// ========================================================

*___Nightingale/t_talk01 n_00
Nightingale, do you have a stationary shop set up somewhere?


*t_00
Nah, I only have myself. Just call for my help and I'll deliver to you!
*
Trekking through the wilderness and over the mountains with my endless love!

*n_01
That sounds pretty cool...
*n_02
But sometimes I get the urge to shop and it's difficult to find you, which is a hassle.

*t_01
Ahh, well, yeah...I am just a cute little girl. I can't be everywhere at once.

*t_02
I pretty much go to wherever I sense someone might be around. 
*
I'm sure if you kill some time by waiting at a bench, there's a good chance I'll show up!



// ========================================================
// MARK : t_talk02
// ========================================================
*___Nightingale/t_talk02 n_00
My family runs an alchemy workshop on the outskirts of the forest.

*t_00
Ahh I know that place! So, you're one of the Cornehl's, princess?

*n_01
Yes. We get a lot of patrons and there aren't many monsters nearby. I think it might be a good place for you to make some money.

*t_01
...Hmm~ I appreciate the offer, but...y'know~


*n_02
Did you have a bad experience there before?

*t_02
Ahh, no, it's just that...the guards dispatched there are from the village.
*
And well, my family has kind of reported me as being "missing"...


*n_03
...You ran away from home?

*t_03
Yeah, but I've got a good reason! It's just...complicated. Anyway, I don't want those guards catching me wandering around there.


*n_04
<think>Is she a wanted person? Maybe that's why she hasn't settled in one place...

// ========================================================
// MARK : t_talk_hpred
// ========================================================
*___Nightingale/t_talk_hpred t_00
Wah, princess, you're all torn up. Are you alright?

*n_00
<m fadein>I-I'm alright...I think I can still fight.

*t_01
If someone's really alright, they'd respond to that question with "Why do you ask?". 

*t_02
Don't push yourself so hard! Now, c'mere and let big sis give you a hug!

*n_01
...if you could sell me something that would help me recover, I think that would be enough.

*t_03
Sure thing! 
<W3><m ple>...Wait, you don't want my hug?! Ehh?!

Is it true that large monsters have been showing up more frequently in this area?

*t_01
<I><m scary>Nope! <m>None! There's definitely nothing like that going on!

*n_02
But, the guard said there are eyewitness reports...

*t_03
<I><m ple>If word gets out that those dangerous things are swarming all over the place, my business will be doomed!
*t_04
<m ple>People pass through this forest on their way between the city and the village, so for me it's a nice marketplace with a lot of customers!

*n_05
I think my friend might have been captured by the monsters. If you have any info, would you please tell me?

*t_06
<m joy>...Don't look at me like that~.
*t_07
The thought of the princess and her friend crying while in mortal danger is enough to give me nightmares...but I guess I have no choice.

*t_07b
Okay, there's a massive cave-in near the drawbridge en route to the city...
*
Reported sightings of the large monster are spotty and disjointed, but I'm thinking that's probably its work.

*n_08
An intelligent monster?
*t_09
Sounds unreal, right? The scholars in the village think <i>"monsters are primitive organisms, with no capacity for intelligence"</i>,
*
but I disagree.
I saw them work systematically to protect the mana plants.
*
It's very possible that they sense the danger of being outnumbered by an army of elves and are hiding to wait out the storm.

*n_10
Then, what if Ixia...my friend was captured?

*t_11
...She might be kept alive as a hostage.

*n_12
...I have to go save her.
*t_13
<m ple>W-Wait! Judging by the scale of the cave-in, the monster is really big and powerful!
*t_14
I probably shouldn't mention this, but worst-case scenario if you lose to that thing and the elven forces arrived late...
*
...at that point, saving just two cadets won't be the first thing on their minds...

*n_15
They would prioritize the extermination of the large monster over saving our lives...to protect the city?

*t_16
I'm just saying it's a possibility! I might be biased since I don't trust people from the village, but still, just in case!
*
So, princess,
make sure you are prepared for anything!
*t_17
<m joy>If you purchase from Nightingale's Whimsical Shop now, I can offer you great items for 0% off the price!

*n_18
Y-You're not giving a discount...?

*t_19
It's one thing to make a sale, it's another thing to make a profit!
