*s12_7a w_00
First time I've been called down from the mountain in a while, and it's to clean up this awful mess.
*
Requests from upper Grazia are always somethin’, aren’t they.

// ノエルに気付く
*w_01
You a student, lass?
Ah, right, this is a school route, isn't it?


*w_01b
Well, sorry, but the road's closed.
*w_01c
...Hm? You wanna help?
Well then, I'd 'preciate it if you could check up on muh bud.

*w_01d
That idjit always spends too much time on his safety checks before he actually starts blasting. 
*
He's probably hangin' ‘round nearby, lettin’ the grass grow under his feet.
*w_01e
If he’s not payin’ attention though, a mana plant might spring up and knock ‘im on his ass! <m scary>GAHAHAHA!

// 発破かける = explode A (Aを爆弾などで爆破して破壊　する）



*w_02
Oh by the by, don’t be castin’ spells near me. That magic stuff’s a wee bit toxic for us mountain-folk.
*w_02b
Shouldn’t be any reason fer ya to anyway, the officers are doing everything they can to keep the mana plants from sproutin’ up here.
*
Whatta tough job that must be.


// *1
*w_03
My buddy should be hangin' ‘round here somewhere.

*w_03b
If you find him, tell him Walross is fixin' to kick his ass.


// 5-B 服が破れてる状態でヴァーロスと話す
*w_04
What's up with your clothes, lass? You tryin' to seduce me or somethin'?
*w_04b
Sorry, but I'm only interested in my own kind. In fact, right now I'm thinkin' 'bout how to hit on that cutie I met back at the bar.

*w_04c
Course, my wife would tan my hide if she ever found out. <m scary>GAHAHA!
*w_04d
...Oh, not sayin' yer ugly or nothin'.
*
I'm sure you could have any man you wanted no matter how you dressed. 
Just don't let 'em take advantage of you.

Uh, I'm still alive...

Hm!? Oh, you're an elf...

Sorry about that. I haven't met very many elves...

Is there anything I can help you with?

// ～～分岐ここまで

*s_11
Ah, yeah, actually there is. 
*
Right now I'm in so much trouble that I'm contemplating if life is even worth living.

// 穴の底の沼を指す
*s_12
...You see that yucky black stuff down there?
I accidentally dropped the explosives I need for work into it.
*
I want to go in and get them back, but there’s mana plants inside. 
*
Also, it feels like <m cry>something<m>'s moving around down in there...
*
At the moment, my plan is to hope <m joy>the explosives somehow float back up by themselves...

*n_13
Well, my classmates and I need the road cleared so we can get to school, and I’ve dealt with mana plants before, so...
*
would you like me to retrieve them for you? 

*s_14
R-Really? Phew...
<m joy>I guess miracles really do happen if you have a little faith...

*s_14b
I dropped <c blue>two sets of explosives.<c>
If you can get both of them back, I'll be eternally grateful!
*s_14c
They may have sunk into the swamp, but it doesn’t look to be that deep...

*n_15
<think><m fadein>He dropped two of them... Is it really safe to have someone like him managing explosives....?

*s_04
Yes. I see elven merchants come up the mountain to restock on them sometimes, so I thought you might appreciate it.

Well, I’d better head back. Thank you once again! Take care!

I’ve never been to the mountains before. I wonder if there are other beastmen living there like...uhh...whoever he was...

Are you okay?

*n_02
<m fadein>Ah...sorry mister...
I wasn’t able to get the explosives...

*s_03
<m scary>P-p-p<m>lease don’t worry about it!

I managed to grab the explosives while the monsters had their backs turned and made a mad dash back out.

*n_04
<think>......
Thank goodness, at least it wasn’t all for nothing.

<think>I wish he’d stop staring at me with such pity, though...uuu.

Oh, uh...um...I’m not sure what to do... Should I call someone from the village, or...?

<m fadein>I’m alright. I can still walk on my own. Besides, I’m kind of...used to this.

I got both. They're pretty heavy... They won't explode, w-will they?

// 扉が閉まる
*n_01
<m ple>!?
*
There's definitely something lurking down in the mire...
Whatever it is might think I'm plucking mana plants while I'm digging for the explosives...

*n_02
...Fighting in the swamp wouldn't be a great idea. 
*
If I really have to take them on, I need to be aware of my footing.



// 8-D: 先に戦闘したあとに爆弾を拾った場合
*n_03
Maybe it's a good thing I took them out first so I could search for the explosives without panicking.

Let's get them back to that beastman.





// 10-A 
*s12_10a w_00
Oh, it’s the little elf lady from before!
I hear you helped my partner clean up the mess he made!

*s_01
T-thanks for that...

*n_02
And thank you Mr Beastman...for opening the road again.

*w_03
There’s still some bits left to clean up, but thanks to your help, we were able to punch through the blockade!
*
You can go on through if you want.

*s_04
Yeah, we’re about...90% done. We still have to reinforce the walls in 12 different places to keep it from collapsing again...

*w_05
Ahhhh we’ll git ta that later!
*
I’m Walross, by the way. And this little fella is Ostrea. 
*w_05b
We’re miners from up
in the mountains.
Sorry fer all the trouble we caused ya’.

*n_06
My name is Noel Cornehl. Pleased to meet you.


// ～～ 沼で敗北した場合はここでカレー粉がもらえる
*w_07
I got a feelin’ you might appreciate these.

// スパイスの小瓶
*n_08
Are these...spices from Mt. Fallen?

*w_09
Not somethin’ that grows ‘round these parts, eh?
*
I see elven merchants travel up the mountain just to stock up on ‘em.

*w_10
Give ‘em a try next time yer preppin’ a meal.
I think you’ll like ‘em!



// 11-A もう一度ヴァーロスと話す


*s12_11a w_00
We really owe you a debt of gratitude, lass.
*
If yer house ever needs remodeling, just lemme know. I’ll fly in from the miner’s settlement.

*w_01
Although...my travel and labor costs might be a bit high for ya’!<m scary>GAHAHA!

*n_01
<think>That sounds more like an advertisement than a favor...

// 12-A オストレアと話す



*s12_12a s_00
Thanks for your help earlier! Those explosives really did the trick, as you can see.
*
We’ll finish cleaning up the rest of the debris in a bit.

*s_01
My air filtration unit needs a replacement soon... Oh, how I miss the low-magic air of the mountains.


// 11-B 服が破れた状態でもう一度ヴァーロスと話す



*s12_11a w_02
So lass, is walking around in tatters a hobby a’ yers?
*
Battle scars are like medals of honor for a village ruffian, but on a pretty young lady like you, it just ain’t right.
*w_03
I’d love to fix ‘em up for you, but needlework ain’t one of my specialties. 
*w_04
I’d pro’bly just end up reducin’ ‘em to scraps. <m scary>GAHAHA!!



// 12-B 服が破れた状態でオストレアと話す


*s12_12a s_03
Honestly, your appearance is making it difficult for me to take the measurements I need here.
*
I think you should do something about your clothes as soon as possible.
*s_04
I know that makes me sound like a meddlesome old fogey...
*
but with you being an elf, I’m certain that you’re actually the older one between the two of us.
	




*s12_15a xa_00
I definitely landed more hits than you...

*xb_01
No way. Besides, my White Arrow struck a vital organ, so I dealt more damage than you.

*xa_02
Psh, it shrugged that off like it was nothin'. Also I severed it's thickest root, so...

*xb_03
Tch, only because I...

*xa_04
It was all me...

*
Oh, you're not the commander. Their outfit is white just like yours.
*
Which unit are you from?　You should probably get to your post before the commander sees you slacking off.

*x_01
Did you hear about the heavy damage our unit sustained during the last battle? 
*
We had to use most of our supplies.
*
I'm checking to see what's left right now. Where was I, 90...no, 86...?
*
Guess I'm starting over...


// 15-D: 同人物に服が破れた状況で話しかける

*x_02
94, 95...yikes, there are still a lot of troops that haven't received their supplies...
*
These ones are being sent straight to the front lines, you'll have to go to the office to get yours.
*x_03
<think>...is this girl even in our army? 
*
<think>If a cutie like her was on the front lines, I'd definitely be distracted watching her get atta-...I mean, avoid attacks...

*n_04
Um...

*x_05
Oh, sorry, it's nothing! Now, where was I...oh yeah, checking the supplies...
*

Ixia was born there, but she's been living in a dorm since she became a student,

and hasn't been back to her parent's place in awhile.

This area has been designated as a military zone.
*
Excuse me...you there, what unit are you from?
Could you check the area to see if anyone was left behind?
*x_01
...You're a student in Grazia? You must have really slept in. Back when I was a student...

Nevermind, that's not important. 
Like I said, this is a military zone.

All the eerie relics scattered about here are creeping me out.
*
Even though they're lying in ruins, it feels like they could start moving again at any moment.
*
There have been reports of the "Pink-haired Phantasm" going around recently. 
*
She's been wandering the forest for decades, her appearance untouched by the passage of time.
*
<m scary>Honestly if I ever saw her, I'd be scared out of my wits.<m>
*
It's said she was standing in front of one of these ancient devices when her physical form suddenly disappeared...
*
Oh, the horror...the horror...
