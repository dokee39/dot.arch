*s04_1a n_00
Ixia gave you the magic device, didn't she?

*p_01
She did! Please register it whenever you're ready.



*s04_1a n_02
...Why is the device floating?

*p_03
Well...the servers for the authentication system are located at the Heavenly Facilities in Grazia.
*
Maybe it gets a better signal up there?




// ========================================================
// MARK : s04_1b
// ========================================================

*s04_1b n_00
S-Something amazing just happened!
Sorry about my dress lifting up...

*p_01
After the attack, spell device authentication has become even more complex.
*
It's got something called three-step authentication and uses WiFu technology to communicate with the servers.
*p_01_2
But it's almost twice as heavy as before, and can still only be used once.
*
Transporting them has become such a pain.


*p_02
The spell you registered was the <c red>Ground Bomb<c>.
It compresses mana into a small sphere that sticks to floors and walls.

*p_03
It'll automatically explode when any monster comes near and put them in a daze, so it's good for crowd control.
*
Give it a try.



*n_04
...? What's this?


*p_05
It's a candy box...with a letter inside?
*
'To the 18-year-old me, how are you? My dream is to become a cool magician like big sis'. 

*n_06
Uwa! Uwa!! This is the time capsule I buried so that I can open it with my sister! 
*
We weren't supposed to open it for another three years!!

*p_07
Teehee... 
*
Just like that, your bombs can blow up the floor or walls that look like they might have something in them.
*
If you think something looks suspicious, use it and see.


*p_08
I got you something else. A gift to celebrate your recovery.


*n_09
Waah, thank you so much...

*p_10
It's actually a skill for athletes. You've always had a spring in your step, though, so I figured you might be able to master it.
*p_10_2
...By the way, do you remember how to set your skills?



*p_20
Well then, let's practice, shall we? Try opening the menu.

*p_21
You can set the skills you obtained from the 'Skills' menu.

*p_22
Now you know how to choose the 'Skill' menu.
*
The skills you just acquired are in the 'Defense' tab. Try opening it.
<key ltab/> / <key rtab/>

*p_23
There is a 'Use' checkbox next to the 'Dodge' and 'Shield' skills. Check or uncheck them to choose whether they are active or not.


*p_24
Well done!
*
<key lsh/> deploys a shield, and <key lsh/>+<key la/><key ra/> performs a dodge!






*p_25
By the way, this is just an example so it's still set to off.
*
Normally when you obtain a skill, it will be on by default. So don't worry about setting it every time you get a new skill.

*p_26
Now, let's begin the practical skill test!


// 3-A へ

// 2-B ====================================

*p_27
That's what I thought, but I had to check. Now then─
*p_28
Let's begin the practical skill test!


*n_29
Y-yes!


// ========================================================
// MARK : s04_3a
// ========================================================
*s04_3a p_00
Mm...hup.


*p_01
I'm going to cast a spell at you, please try to block it.

*n_02
Okay...!

*p_03
We'll start with practice drills for shields.
*
<key lsh/><c red>While your shield is active, you can protect yourself from toxic gases.
*p_04
Keep the shield up so you don't inhale the gas from my spell. Let's begin!





*s04_3b n_00
...Ha!

*p_01
Are you all right? You inhaled a lot of gas and fainted.

*n_02
I-I'm sorry. I'll do better next time...

*p_03
If you put up your shield for a long time, it will glow red and its strength will drop.
*
But, <c red>as long as you do not receive physical damage, it will not break<c>. So, you can keep the shield up until the gas dissipates.

*p_04
...Okay then, once again! This time, be careful not to breathe in the gas!





// 3-F: 成功 ====================
*s04_3f p_00
Well done!
*p_01
In a real battle, when your shield is weakened by gas, there is the danger of it being broken by an enemy's physical attack.
*
In some cases, it might be more advantageous to move away from the gas rather than using your shield.

*n_01
Okay!


*p_02
Let's move on to the next skill.




// 3-C: 失敗パターン2 ( シールドを貼らずに逃げる ) ====================
*s04_3c p_00
...You do understand we're practicing using shields, right?

*p_01
Of course, in a real battle there will be times when staying away from the gas altogether is more viable, but...

*p_02
Even so, is simply keeping up a shield too easy for a model student like you?



// 3-D
*n_03
I'm sorry, I'll do it properly this time!

*p_04
Very well. Then I'll use the same spell again.


// 3-E
*p_05
I understand. In deference to your eagerness, we'll move on to the next skill.

*p_06
After the shield has been kept up for some time, it will glow red.
*
If an enemy's attack hits the shield while it's red, the shield will be destroyed.
*
When that happens, you will be knocked down and defenseless for a while, so be extra careful.



// ========================================================
// MARK : 回避訓練
// ========================================================


*s04_4a p_00
Next up is the dodge skill. Try using it a few times first to get a feel for it.


*s04_4a_2 p_01
Well done. You're invincible while dodging. Use it to avoid enemy attacks.


*p_02
Okay, I'm going to cast a shockwave spell. Don't worry, it's set to be non-lethal, so it shouldn't hurt too much.
*
Even at normal strength, a beastman's spell would probably only scratch an elf.

*n_03
So...I should take this seriously to avoid getting hit in the face?

*p_04
So perceptive! I'll have you try to dodge not just once, but several times in a row!
*
I wonder if you can still do it so soon after your recovery?

*n_05
I'll do my best!





// 4-B: 被弾1回目
*s04_4b p_00
...Are you okay? Did you hit your head?

*n_01
I-I'm fine... I'll dodge it next time!

*p_02
Ahem. Watch the shockwave carefully and dodge towards me when it's about to hit you. I know you can do it.


// 4-C: 被弾2回目
*n_03
Uuu... Please, let me try one more time.

*p_04
Maybe I'm going a little too fast. I'll leave more space between each cast this time.


// 4-D: 被弾3回目以降
*n_05
I-I'm sorry...

*p_06
There's no need to rush. But...hmm, maybe you still aren't back to full strength yet. Do you want to try again?

// 4-E
*n_07
I'll get it right this time!

*p_08
Thatta'girl, Noel! Try as many times as you like!
*
Just as the shockwave is about to hit, dodge towards me and glide over the wave. Keep calm, you got this.


// 4-F
*p_09
I understand. I'm sure you'll be fine. It might be more efficient to get used to it in a real fight.


// 4-G: 成功 ========================



*s04_4g n_00
I-I did it!

*p_01
Great job! I thought it would be a little difficult...but you've mastered dodging as easily as I expected!


// 4-H: 成功 (シールドを張って昏倒しながら無理やり突破した)  ========================



*s04_4h n_00
I-I did it...hehehe...

*p_01
It's dangerous to take such hits during an actual battle, but I'll give you a pass for your quick turnaround.




// 5-A



*s04_5a p_00
...Now, let's do a final wrap-up on everything we've learned so far!

*p_01
Avoid inhaling too much gas and dodge the shockwaves at the same time. Let's begin!




// 5-B: 失敗パターン1（ガスで寝てしまう） ====================



*s04_5b n_00
...Ha-

*p_01
Are you okay? You inhaled a lot of gas and fainted.

*n_02
I'm sorry. I'll do better next time...

*p_03
Even if you are in the area of the gas, the effects of it won't kick in immediately.
*
You can't breathe in fresh air while the shield is up, but you can at least look for an area where the gas is clearing up.


*p_04
Don't be too hasty. Stay calm. Okay, once again!



// 5-B: 失敗パターン2（衝撃波被弾） ====================


*s04_5b_2 n_00
Ow...

*p_01
Are you okay!? Are you hurt anywhere!?

*n_02
I just scraped my hips a little... P-please, one more time!

*p_03
...I understand. Let's start!


// 5-C: 何度も失敗する ====================

*s04_5c p_00
...I'm sorry, is this a bit too difficult?


*n_01
Uu...it's...



// 5-D
*n_02
No, I can still continue...!

*p_03
You've just recovered, so don't overdo it.
*p_04
But since you're up to the challenge... I will continue to fire without restraint!


// 5-E
*n_05
I-I'd like to leave it at that for today...

*p_06
...I understand.
*
Take a look at your 'Skills' menu if you ever forget how to use one.



// 5-F: 成功  ====================


*s04_5f p_00
Very well done!
It was a complicated move, but you mastered it with ease.
*
Noel, I really think you are worthy of being called the school's genius.

*n_01
T-That's too much praise...but thank you for helping me practice!

*p_02
If you forget how to use any skill, have a look at the 'Skills' menu for instructions.




// ========================================================
// MARK : s04_6a
// ========================================================


*s04_6a n_00
Thank you so much for coming today, Ms. Primula. I know it's a long trip to get here from town.
*
You even went to the trouble of bringing your staff and those ancient documents...

*p_00
Oh don't worry about me. I couldn't bear the thought of having such a cute, bright student fall behind everyone else.

// しばらく無言

*p_01
Tell me, Noel... 
Do you have any dreams you'd like to achieve someday?

*n_02
My dream... 
*
is to be a great magician, travel the world...and...become someone's hero... 

*n_03
No, no, what am I saying? That's so embarrassing. It sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it?


*p_03
Not at all. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
*p_04
You're definitely not a fairy tale princess.
*p_04_2
But, it's okay to yearn for an adventure down the 'rabbit hole'.

*n_04
Adven...ture...

*p_05
Yes. I have every bit of confidence that you can do it. 
*
You are an excellent student, after all. I see great things in your future.

*n_06
Thank you, sensei.

*n_07
...May I ask what your dream is?


*p_07
...I'd like to meet my previous incarnation...and give her a good slap for not transferring her memories.

*n_08
Ahaha...

*p_09
You know that we true beastmen have a very short physical lifespan, so we extend our lives by transferring our memories to a new body-
*
-through a process called 'reincarnation' at the 'Heavenly Facilities'.

*n_10
Right.

*p_11
By transferring my memories into a newly cloned body, I 'Primula' can continue to exist.
*
...But, when you think about it, wouldn't that mean the previous Primula died when her memories weren't transferred?



*n_12
...I've heard that when they prepare the clone, they renew the body's stem cells.

*p_13
Even so, if we consider my consciousness to be a continuation of my inherited memories...
*
...one could say that I'm already dead, and now I'm nothing more than a zombie, couldn't they?

*n_14
...

*p_15
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up such a depressing matter. Just take what I said as a joke.

*n_16
It's a bit too serious of an issue to take it that way...


*p_17
Yeah...I suppose. You know what I'd really like to see? The stars.

*n_18
Stars...?

*p_19
It's a legend I heard from Shasta. Right now, the night sky is covered with a cloud of magical power that never clears.
*
Beyond this cloud, there is a black ceiling glittering with countless jewels called 'Stars'.

*n_20
Jewels in the sky...is that a fairy tale of the lost civilization?

*p_21
It's unbelievable, isn't it? I laughed so hard when Shasta first told me. She was speaking so seriously.
*
But after reading the old documents that were deciphered, I don't think it's just a fairy tale.

*p_22
 ……<c black><i>”Beyond the clouds that bring the blessed rains, in the 'CRADLE' high above the Mother Tree, our father lies in sleep“</i></c>.

*n_22
That's a verse from the Grazian Orthodoxy.

*p_23
There are rumors that a very small handful of powerful people have access to the top level hidden in Grazia's Heavenly Facilities.
*
If the 'CRADLE' in this doctrine really exists...
*
I'm sure I'll be able to see the stars with my own eyes from there.

*n_24
...

*p_25
Just kidding. I think Shasta's habit of exaggerating may have rubbed off on me a bit.
*p_26
...Well, I'm off for today. I'll see you tomorrow evening after I finish my work at school.
*
We'll talk about your return then.

*n_26
I understand. Please take care on your way back.

*p_27
Good night, Noel.



*n_50
<I><w2><m fadein>A world where flowers, mice and cards talk to each other.


*n_51
<I><w2><m fadein>A world where jewels shine on the ceiling above the sky.

I felt a spark of warmth that night. Like a fire had been rekindled in my wounded heart.
