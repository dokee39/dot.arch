*___Fatal/snake b00

A soothing coldness enveloped Noel, rousing her from unconsciousness.
As she awoke, she noticed serpentine shadows winding across her entire body.

*___Fatal/snake b00_2
(Wha-what's happening!?)

Panicking, Noel tried to remember the events that led her here.
She had set out to rescue her friend from the clutches of a monster,
and now found herself face to face with...
*___Fatal/snake b00_3
(Ixia!?)

Panic turned to terror as the reality of her situation sunk in...
she had been captured as well.
*
"Noel Cornehl, I don't need your help!
I can get out of this all by myse-AH!"

*___Fatal/snake b01
The serpent silenced her outburst.
　
"Yah! Ah! Don't touch me there!"

*___Fatal/snake b01_2
Separate tentacles began rubbing up against their lower lips,
attempting to weaken their resolve. Disgusted, they clenched
their openings tightly with each stroke the tentacle made.
*
"Ixia!"

If she didn't do something quickly, Noel knew
things would end up just like last time.
*
Shaking her head to keep the bad memories at bay,
she noticed her staff out of the corner of her eye.
She called out to it...
*
"Come-..."
　
...but before she could finish...

//触手飲み込み
*___Fatal/snake b02

*gulp* *choke* *cough cough*
...a tentacle was forced into each of their mouths.

*
(Mm! Hnmmmmmmm!!)
　
Their screams were muffled by the soft, slimy tentacle
as it slithered its way to the back of their throats.

*___Fatal/snake b03

A wet gurgling sound came from the tentacle.
*
Viscous liquid began to pour forth, oozing down into their esophagus.
Unable to spit it out, they had no choice but to swallow it.
Their minds were gripped with fear, blocking out all other thoughts.

*___Fatal/snake b03_2
*Cough* *Cough* *Choke*
*
The torture of being suffocated had broken their will to resist.
Foul-smelling liquid continued to drip down their throats,
its unpleasant sensation gradually turning to one of numbness.

*___Fatal/snake b03_3
(What is...this feeling...?)

*
Noel felt strangely comfortable.
The tentacle pulsated in her mouth as she relaxed.
*
A gentle warmth stirred within her, as if a fire had been lit.
The numbness in her chest began spreading to her mind,
melting away all her worries.

*___Fatal/snake b05 // 挿入

"--!!"

Suddenly, a tentacle pierced into Ixia, deflowering her.
A sharp pain flashed through her body, causing her eyes to go blank.

*___Fatal/snake b05_2
"--ah."

Blood poured from her vagina as the tentacled pulled out.
Not allowing her a moment to recover, it thrust back inside.

*___Fatal/snake b05_3
"Guh! Uwaah! S-stoooop!"

Ignoring her cries, the tentacle began thrusting faster.

*___Fatal/snake b05_4
"Aaaaaaah!!"

Ixia's screams were earsplitting...

*___Fatal/snake b05_5
...but to Noel's numbed mind,
sounded as if they were a million miles away.

*___Fatal/snake b05_6
"Dammit, let go of me!!"

The monster continued its relentless assault,
pouring its slimy mucus into her previously virginal opening.
*
Amidst Ixia's screams, Noel could hear the deep,
dark sounds of pulsating shadows all around her.

*___Fatal/snake b05_7
Knowing she had to do something,
she gathered what little courage she had left.
*
Sensing her resolve, the monster constricted
each of her limbs before she could act.
*
*Grrrr* *Uroooaaar*
That sound. The monster's overwhelming force.
Noel's memories were being pried open,
her trauma brought back in full focus.

//イクシャ泣き顔

*___Fatal/snake b06
"Stop...please..."

Tears streamed down Ixia's face.
*
Noel wished so desperately to wipe them away,
to ease her suffering if only a little.
But with her arms constricted, all she could do was watch.

//ノエル泣き顔
*___Fatal/snake b06_2

Although the events unfolding in front of her were painful to watch
Noel's heart pounded in her chest as the fire within her began to grow.
Ixia met Noel's gaze with blurry, tear-filled eyes.

*___Fatal/snake b06_3
"Noel...help me..."

But there was nothing she could do.
She was captured prey, all the same.

*
"Ixia..."

The monster tightened its grip, pushing its prey closer together.
A soft gasp of pain escaped their lips.
*
They were so close now that their tongues
could bridge the gap between them.

*___Fatal/snake b07
"Mmn...pah"

At the very least, now Noel could
wipe away Ixia's tears and some of the mucus.
She began running her tongue over Ixia's face.

*___Fatal/snake b07_2
Unbothered by the taste of salty tears and
bitter mucus mixing in her mouth, Noel licked frantically.
If this would soothe Ixia's pain, it was worth it.

*___Fatal/snake b07_3
"Mm...chu"

The heat from the fire in their bellies
began spreading throughout their bodies.
*
Noel's fire grew hotter with each flick
of her tongue against Ixia's soft cheeks.
*
She wanted to feel good.
*___Fatal/snake b07_4
Without even thinking, her leg had already
crept towards Ixia's precious parts.
*
The spots where her skin had been restrained
were soft, bruised and painful.

//ノエル挿入差分

*___Fatal/snake b08
"...Mmn"

The tentacles began thrusting into Noel's secret place as well.
Her abdomen was set ablaze as the fire churned and swirled within her.

*___Fatal/snake b08_2
//ピストン高速

"Ixia! Ixia!"
"Noel...Aaaah!"
　

*___Fatal/snake b09
//絶頂＋粘液中出し

*___Fatal/snake b10
Mucus gushed forth from the tentacle, dousing the fire
and sending waves of pleasure throughout her body.
*
Her mind went blank as the lingering sensation of the fire
mixed with the cooling mucus.

//ノエル投げ飛ばされ

*___Fatal/snake b11
Noel felt heavy.
*
All of her mana had been drained during her climax.
The monster violently threw Noel's limp body to the ground.
It took several seconds for the pain to register to her blank mind.
*___Fatal/snake b11_2
"Nmph...wah! Stop, no more...!"

"I've already...ah...hii...aahn...more...right theeeere."

*
Noel didn't have the strength to raise her head.
All she could hear was Ixia's voice.
She had been used up and tossed to the ground like a dirty rag.

*
She did not listen to her sister's advice,
nor did she ask for help from any adults.
She had repeated her past mistakes,
and now her friend was paying the price.
*
(Don't you ever stop to think!?)
(How could you...!?)
(I can't believe I used to envy you!)

*___Fatal/snake b12
"I'm...sorry..."

That was all she managed to utter.
*
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry...!"
Noel continued to silently whisper her apologies
until the last of her strength faded away.

*___Fatal/snake b12_2
Even though it wouldn't change anything.
