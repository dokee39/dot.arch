Hey! Are you okay?

*n_01
Eh...I'm...in Grazia?

*mb_02
Someone reported seeing an elf go down to the roots of the Sacred Tree.
*
We finally found you after 3 days of searching.

*n_03
3 days...was I really out that long...?

*mb_04
Please be more careful. When an elf wanders too close to the sanctuary, it's a beastman's duty to go in after them.
*
And we're already stretched thin with our normal workload.

Sorry. Thank you for rescuing me.
