<angry /><m joy><big>Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!</big></m>

*i_01
I got here before you, Noel Cornehl!

*n_02
Ixia! I haven't seen you in two weeks.


*i_03
Um, if you don't mind me asking...How are you feeling? Any pain still?

*n_04
I'm fine. I was even able to defeat a monster earlier.

*i_05
You were fighting!? How could you be so reckless!




*n_06
T-there was only one...and it didn't look like I could just avoid it.

*n_07
Just a little bit on the way back...I was able to use my new staff; it didn't hurt or anything.




*i_08
Hmph! For the past two weeks, your teachers and friends have been so worried about you. 
*i_09
But, that's actually a relief to hear. Even though so much of your mana was absorbed during the incident...
*
It sounds like you'll still be able to compete against me as my rival.

*n_09
...Have I ever lost to you, Ixia?

*i_10
<angry /><m scary>The audacity!</m><W2 />
Next time you come to school I'm going to beat you for sure!

*n_11
If you say so. I'll talk to sensei today about potentially returning to school.
*i_12
<W3 />Well, just don't let the monsters get you again!


// 去る

// すぐ戻ってくる

*i_13
Almost forgot~~!


*i_14
One of the spells you broke during the incident has finally been remade...So I brought it with me today!

*n_15
And here I thought you had come to visit me.

*i_16
Don't get so full of yourself! Let's see, I think it was...ah, that's right. 

*i_17
Ms. Primula came by earlier, so I gave it to her!


*n_17
Sensei is already here? She's a little earlier than usual.

*i_18
I'm sure she's waiting for you in your room.
*
You can thank me by learning to use that spell with your new staff!

*n_19
Thank you, Ixia. See you in school.

*i_20
Hmph! ...Make sure you're there!


*n_21
Ixia is the same as always. I'm glad she wasn't hurt during the incident.

*n_22
...She said sensei is waiting in my room. I'd better go see her.

*s01_ixia_2b_00 i_00
<m ple>Noel Cornehl!?
What...what happened to you!?

*n_01
Ixia...I was out gathering materials for my sister...
and then...I tripped and fell.

*i_02
<m ple>Liar!  You're covered in monster fluids!
<m>...The same as...two weeks ago...

*n_03
Don't worry. There weren't as many monsters this time.

*i_04
...
*n_05
Ixia, are you here to visit me? Shall we go inside?

*i_06
Can't. It's already really close to my curfew. I have to get back to the village...

*n_07
I see...sorry. It's my fault I got back so late.

*n_07b
I see...sorry. I'm such an idiot.

*i_08
<m ple>Don't apologize!

*i_08b
...I'm sure Ms. Primula is waiting for you up in your room. I'll let her take care of you.
*
Oh, and about the spell you broke during the attack...it's been remade and is already seeing production.
*
I gave one to Ms. Primula earlier.

*n_09
The spell? Thank you. Hope it wasn't too much trouble.


*i_10
Hmph! If you're going to worry about anything, worry about your tattered state!

*i_10b
Ok, I really have to go now. Please take care of yourself. Stay away from monsters and perverts!


// 去る
*n_11
...I'm sure Ms. Primula is also worried. Let's get home...

*s01_laevi_3a v_00
Noel, welcome home~

*n_01
I'm back, sister.


*v_02
Hmm~, as expected of my beloved sister~
You've collected everything I asked for~


*v_03
Oh! You mined some ores for me too! Such a model student! Thank you so much for your help~


*n_04
Well, it's not like you asked for much...

*v_05
I was afraid your delicate arms would break from the weight of the materials. 
*
I'm glad you made it back safely.

*n_06
...Thank you.

*v_07
These materials look good, now if only I could obtain that...


// ========================================================
// MARK : s01_laevi_3b
// ========================================================



*s01_laevi_3b v_00
Noel, welcome back~ ...Ah, what happened? That's a rather lewd look for you.

*n_01
Sister, p-please forgive my shameful appearance...

*v_02
There's nothing shameful about your beautiful body and porcelain skin. I'm grateful for the opportunity to admire you like this.

*n_03
I'm not dressed like this on purpose! Monsters attacked me while I was gathering materials...!

*v_04
Ah, is that so.
*v_04_2
Monster semen and eggs are miraculous alchemical ingredients. The only problem is they are difficult to collect and spoil easily.
*
I know, the next time you get covered in monster fluid, come back quickly so I can collect it.

*n_05
...I'll pass.
Anyway, here are the materials you asked for.

*v_06
Wow, good work!
*
Even after being ravaged by the monsters' big black thing, you still came through for me.

*n_07
Please stop!


// ========================================================
// MARK : s01_laevi_4a

*s01_laevi_4a b_00
Um, e-excuse me...Laevi.

*v_01
Huh?  Can I help you?

*b_02
Uhh, I, erm...about my reservation...

*v_03
<m ple>Ah! You're a customer of 
'The room'! <m>You're here a little earlier than your appointment time. Did you want to see me that badly?

*b_04
No, it's just that...well...yes.

*v_05
Ehehe, happy to hear it! I like your honesty, Jade.

*b_06
<m joy>Well, you know me...<m>haha.

*v_07
I'll show you to the back. Let's enjoy today, just the two of us, together...



// 遠目で微妙な表情で眺めるノエル

*v_09
Noel, go upstairs and get Tilde. I need him to watch the store.


*n_10
O-Okay.


// ========

// 客とすれ違う



*n_11
Eek...!

*b_12
Ah, um, 'scuse me...

*v_13
Noel~ If you stand there looking like that, people might think you're using the room with us.
*
...Although, I'm fine with that if you are.

*n_14
N-no! Not in my current state...

*v_15
I know you're a bit worn-out right now, but can you go upstairs and get Tilde? I need him to watch the store.


*n_16
...Okay.



*n_20
...Where might Tilde be?



// ========================================================
// MARK : s01_5b
// ========================================================



*s01_5b n_00
Tilde.

*d_01
Noel, welcome back. Were you able to gather the materials safely?

*n_02
Yeah. Well...I ran into some monsters along the way, but I managed just fine.

*d_03
Dang. I bet 40G on you losing big time again.

*n_04
...

*d_05
You're more or less a grown woman, so when the monsters go for your mana, they target your womb and those uselessly big boobs, right?

*n_06
Eek!! Please don't touch me!

*d_07
I'm thinking of entering the Department of Magical Biology at Grazia. 
*
Monsters prefer young female elves who have a lot of mana like yourself, right?

*n_08
Prefer...
I'd rather not be targeted at all.


*d_09
But, you can get them to make you feel really good, right? Where does your mana leak out when you are attacked? Hm?


// 5-Dへ

*s01_5c n_00
Tilde.

*d_01
Noel, welcome ba...whoa, you got beaten to a pulp.

*n_02
Sorry, I know I'm a bit unsightly right now...

*d_03
Eh, it's okay. I bet 40G on you losing.

*n_04
...

*d_05
Still, I must say elven women make for the best mages. Those huge breasts can store so much mana.

*n_06
Nngh...please don't touch me.

*d_07
Oh, sorry~ Are you still sensitive after being violated? Which part would feel best if touched it?

*n_08
...Maybe that wall over there.

*d_09
Hey, don't glare at me like that. I was just trying to help you feel better.


// 5-Dへ

// 5-D:

*s01_5d n_00
...Tilde, your sister wants you to watch the shop.

*d_01
Geez, not again. What a pain.
*
When I'm working at the store, sometimes I can hear her and the male customers going at it, and it really bothers me.


*n_02
...But she needs to do it to gather materials for her alchemy.

*d_03
Fine, I'll go. Hey, if you're ever up for it, tell me about how you lost your virginity to the monsters.

*n_04
Never!






*s01_5z n_00
...I should probably 
go meet sensei...
She's waiting for me in my room.

*s01_5z n_01
...She's waiting in the garden behind the kitchen.

*s01_5z n_02
...Let's go take sensei's lesson.

*s01_5z n_03
...Let's go meet sensei.

*s01_5z n_04
...I'm hungry.

*s01_5z n_05
...Let's go say good morning to big sis as well.
