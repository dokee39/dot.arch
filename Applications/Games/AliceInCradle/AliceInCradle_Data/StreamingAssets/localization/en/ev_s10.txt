Yawn...my heart was pounding all night long... 
I didn't sleep well at all.

// パジャマからいつもの白い服に着替える

// 2-A 綺麗な場合 ========================
*n_01
I borrowed my grandmother's cadet uniform after my Bermit one got torn to bits two weeks ago...
*
It fits perfectly and is surprisingly easy to move in. I like it.



*n_02
It's not spotless, but it's still pretty clean. Let's keep taking good care of it.

// 3-A 以降へ

// 2-B 1日目に敗北していた場合 ========================
*n_03
I borrowed my grandmother's cadet uniform after my Bermit one got torn to bits two weeks ago...
*n_04
...and it suffered the same fate during yesterday's events.
I wonder if it can ever be fully mended...

*n_05
It's still okay, if you don't look too closely. Let's take better care of it from now on.


*s10_3a n_00
Phew...that was refreshing.
...Huh? Eh?


*n_01
Where did my clothes go...!?




*s10_3a n_02
<m fadein>Ah...um, Tilde, do you know where my clothes are?

*d_03
Huh? Oh. It was time to do laundry, so they're being washed.
*
I mean, you should've left them in the laundry room yesterday.

*n_04
I didn't bring a change of clothes!

*d_05
That's your own fault. Just run down the hallway to the wardrobe.

*n_06
Uu...fine, I'm going. Look away, please...


*d_07
I've already seen you naked when we were kids...it's a little late to worry about it now.


// バスローブ姿で走る

*n_08
<m scary>Kya..!


*n_09
Ow...sorr-...


// はだける
*n_10
<angry><m ple>Kyaaa!! S-sorry, I'm so sorry!

*f_11
...Ahem.

// 父、去る

Uuu...

<m fadein>Mornin', Noel~ Yawn...

*n_01
Good morning, sister. Still not a morning person, huh?

*v_02
Nope. Think I'll sleep at the desk 'til customers arrive. Oh, here...for you.


*n_03
...A letter? Ah, it's from Ixia.

*v_04
Is she the floaty little chatterbox that came in earlier?

// イクシャは杖に乗って飛べる
*n_05
Yes, that's Ixia. She's a friend from school...ah, but she thinks of me as a rival, so she probably doesn't see me as a friend...

*v_06
That's just her roundabout way of saying she loves you, Noel~

*n_07
You think so...?


// 中身を読む


*v_08
See? She must really be into you~
*
She had to go from the village into town, get the spell, come here, and still has to go to school, no~?
*n_09
That all sounds so tiring... Does she really have the energy for that so early in the morning?


*v_10
If so, that's really impressive~ There's no way I could do that...fuwawa...


*v_11
Ah, here comes a customer. 
Welcome~
Alright, time to work!

*n_12
...I should wait a bit for Ixia to come. I can kill some time by talking to the customers and guards.


// 4-B まだこのときチルダに会っていない =============================
*n_13
...I'm hungry.
*
Tilde should be cooking breakfast in the kitchen, I'll go check on him.




// モブのおばあさん



// モブのおばあさん
*s10_4c_bba x_00
Oh my, is that a village military uniform? One for a field medic, if I recall correctly.
*
Did you come here from the village, young lady?

*n_01
Ah, no. I live here, and I'm just borrowing this uniform...

*x_02
Seeing that old uniform really brings back memories. I used to wear the same one when I fought against the monsters...
*
One time, when I was going through what was supposed to be a course for beginners, two contaminated monsters appeared.
*
I was so scared I couldn't even stand up.
*
But Kelly sprang into action and lured the monsters into fighting with each other. I couldn't help but fall in love...

*n_03
That's great, but I really should be going...



*s10_4c_girl x_00
Y-You're shopping here too...? Hehe, you're a bad girl.

*n_01
Bad girl?

*x_02
There's a rumor that this shop is run by the witch who got expelled from the village. 
*
Mom and Dad would scold me if they knew I was coming here. So I woke up early to get here in secret.
*
The path here is scary isn't it? There's a bridge almost overtaken by thorny plants and a place filled with mushrooms...
*
And have you heard the story that someone saw a ghost disappearing into the earth near here?

*n_03
So our house is a source of urban legends...
*n_04
...Although, I did feel some sort of presence yesterday.

*x_04
Then it's true! I-If I buy a talisman here, will the ghost get mad and show itself?

*n_05
Aren't talismans meant to keep ghosts away...?





*s10_4c_srng x_00
There are ways to use your spells other than simply casting them.
*
While chanting a spell, you can 
<c red>dodge or attack<c> to store the spell's power in your cane.
*
Then you can strike the monster with your cane to blast them with its concentrated power!
*
This technique is called 
<c blue>Shotgun<c>. Try it out.
*
Mana stored with this technique is very volatile. It can dissipate easily if you get hit while holding it.
*
Activating Shotgun without fully chanting the spell first will cause its power to be almost nonexistent.
*
It's a powerful technique, but you have to get close to the enemy to use it. Its a high-risk, high-reward thing.






*s10_5a n_00
Good morning.

*x_01
Ah, good morning. You should stay out of the forest today.

*n_02
How come?

*x_03
We've been getting reports of huge monsters going on a rampage.

*n_04
...!


// 地響きがなる
*x_05
Y'hear that? They're really close. The drawbridge at the cliff has been raised, so the route to the village and the city is sealed off.
*
I'm betting the monster is somewhere near the cliff. The village is probably forming a strike team as we speak.
*
As for me...what should I do? Am I allowed to stay put if I say my duty is to protect this place no matter what?


*n_06
Ixia is in danger...!

// N :　走って外へ
*x_07
Huh!? Hey you!



*s10_5b n_00
Even though Ixia has spells to fly away, she's the type to charge into monsters head-first. She might already be in danger!

// 揺れる
*n_01
Kya-waaah!

// こける,橋が崩れる

*n_02
The b-bridge...and the cave's exit is blocked off too...





*s10_5c x_00
You alright? Sounded like something collapsed.

*n_01
The bridge...it's broken and...

*x_02
Whaaat!? Oh no! Ohhhh this is bad...I've gotta call in someone who can fix this...
*
Wait, how can I send word about the only bridge out of here being broken if it's...broken? Are we just stuck here?

*x_03
This sucks...I got chewed out last time just for being late for my shift change... 
*
If my boss deducts my points again, my paycheck will be...

*n_04
There's a small passage below the bridge that leads to the end of the cavern.
*
But there are mana plants growing nearby, so there is a chance you'll run into monsters.

*x_05
Eh? I don't want to do that! 
*
I'm a good-for-nothing nobody who took four years to get his magic license! What makes you think I can fight?

*n_06
<think>Why did this guy become a guard...?


// もう一度話す


*s10_5c x_10
Did you know female elves are far and away the best when it comes to casting spells? 
*
I can't even lift my head up to look such strong women in the eye. I'll never be on their level.

*n_11
If that's the case, shouldn't you work harder to try to score points with them?

*x_12
Exhibiting poor effort is worse than doing nothing at all.
*
Even if they're motivated, it'd be better if such an incompetent person just stopped existing. That's the basics of the basics, y'know?

*n_12
<think>He's not budging...this guy really is useless.
*n_13
<think>There's a small passage below the bridge. I'll go through it even if I'm by myself.

*
<think>I can use the 'Ground Bomb' I got from sensei yesterday to clear the debris from the collapse.
