Again!? 
And it’s really close, too...
Could it be...?

// LifeTeller army
// メーファ (Mepha Gridyard) : P : 女性の軍人。跳ね橋で見張りをしていた青髪の女性と同一人物

*ixiacane_3
<device><noise>Can anyone hear me?
*
<device><noise>This is Commanding Officer Mepha Gridyard of the Elf Village’s Monster Suppression unit.
*
<device><noise>We’re mustering our troops in preparation for a search-and-destroy operation on the large monster.
*
<device><noise>We've engaged this one several times before. 
*
<device><noise>It's most likely wounded and may behave in a wild and unpredictable manner.
*
<device><noise>For your safety, get as far away from it as possible.
*
<device><noise>The monster is in the immediate vicinity of Grazia; retreating to the town may not be safe.
*
<device><noise>If it escapes our forces, it could damage the town’s barrier and injure civilians.
*
<device><noise>The safety of the town is our top priority. We cannot guarantee the rescue of anyone that did not escape in time.
*
<device><noise>If there are any survivors, retreat from the area immediately. I repeat──


*s13_1b n_04
<m ple>What!? But then, what will happen to Ixia!?

*ixiacane_05
<device><noise>A survivor? Calm down. Report the situation to me.

*n_06
...I-I am Noel Cornehl. Class III Cadet of Bermit Academy.
*
I think...one of my friends has been captured by the monster!


*ixiacane_07
<device><noise>...You need to get out of there.
<device><noise>Even though it’s wounded, it's still too much for a cadet to handle.
*
<device><noise>Get as far away
as you can before
it’s too late──


//N:杖を回収し、走って奥へ

*ixiacane_08
<device><noise level="2">You’re breaking up... Can you still hear me? Respond──


*n_09
<m fadein>Is the military really going to just leave Ixia to die...?

*n_09b
<m fadein>I have to get to the monster before they do...
*
<m fadein>...but...can someone like me...really save her?
*
<m fadein>...Am I going to end up like I did on that day...

// ＝あの日みたいに魔族にぼろぼろに敗れる キーーン
*n_10
<m fadein>...

*n_11
No, I can...I WILL SAVE HER!

// 2-Bルートに到達するためには少し寄り道してホーリーバースト（イクシャが運んできた魔術）を回収する必要がある。

*s13_3a n_00
<think>W-what? I thought each device had an identity verification system that allowed only the designated user to register it...?
*n_01
<think>...So this was supposed to be registered to my staff? But, that would mean...

*n_02
<think>...Ixia got attacked while trying to bring this to me...

*n_03
<think>Hmm, it’s called...Holy Burst.
Looks like my staff has a dedicated slot for it...my old one never had anything like that.
*
<think>Let's see...it’s a spell that doesn’t need to be chanted...
*
<think>If it’s meant to be used in emergencies, I’d better test it out so I know how it works.

// バーストを撃つ

*n_04
<m scary>Gah!? Hah, ahh...
<W3><m fadein>phew...

*n_05
<think><m fadein>W-what was that? My heart felt like it was stuck in a vice.
*
<think>This spell must use some powerful form of mana-magnetism to be cast without chanting.
*n_06
<think>...Using this spell multiple times in rapid succession would <c red>definitely cause bad things<c> to happen...especially when I'm low on mana.
*n_07
<think>...But that blast was really powerful. I’ll keep it registered so I can use it when I need to.

*n_08
<m fadein>...Fuu, haa. 
<W3><m>Okay, I’m good.


// ==================
// 3-B : 2-A を見る前に探しに来た

*n_09
Judging from the broken staff I saw earlier, Ixia's probably in a lot of trouble...!

*n_10
I need to hurry back and find that large monster!



// ==================
// 3-C : 2-A を見た後に探しに来た

*n_11
This is the spell Ixia was trying to tell me about...

*n_12
I have to hurry back to her...!

Huu, haa, uuu...


*n_01
<angry>...Ixia!


*i_02
H-ep...nnn...N...Noel...

*n_03
<think><m ple>She's already 
lost a lot of mana...!
I have to help her, quickly!
// ボスの咆哮

*n_04
It’s...a big one...


// ここからバーストを所持しているかどうかで分岐

// ====================================
// 2-A: バーストを所持せずに到達

<m ple>It’s ok, I’m here to save you!
*
I’ll get you out of this cage and─

*i_07
<I><m scary>Nnnnmmm!! Nnnnnm!!

*n_08
...?

*
<think>She's shaking her head at me...
<c red>am I missing something?



// システムメッセージでかなり強く引き返させる。
// 無理やり戦うと確定でゲームオーバー

<I><m fadein>Ahh...ow...stop...my stomach...

*n_11
<angry>It’s ok, I’m here to save you! I’ll get you out of this cage and─


*i_12
<m fadein>Don’t...! It’s a trap-
<m scary>mmph!!

// イクシャ口をふさがれる
*n_13
A trap...?

*n_14
<think>It’s holding Ixia like she’s a piece of bait...
*
<think>Is the monster’s strategy to lure me into attacking the cage...?

*i_14
<I><m fadein>Mmm, nho...haaah...


*n_15
<think>I don't have time to think this over...!
*
<think>If the monster does have any surprises for me, I can use my <c blue>Holy Burst<c> to get out of trouble!





*s13_ixia_battle i_getout
You need...burst...


*s13_ixia_battle i_00
Uwah...my...ma...na...
it’s draining...

Ahh, hah, huah...

Stop...no more...

It’s vulnerable...!

*i_05
Now’s your chance,
Noel Cornehl!


// 攻撃チャンス終了→イクシャが一旦手出しできないバックヤードに連れ去られる

KYAAAAA!

NO MORE, NOOO...!




// ==================


// 4-A 撃破した

*s13_4a n_00
<W1><m fadein>...Haa...<W2>Haa...<W2>
did I...<W2>do it?

*i_01
<m fadein>...Yes...just as...<W2>
I...knew you would, Noel...Cor...

// イクシャ気を失う

*n_02
<I>Ixia!!


// 暗転

*n_03b
<w2><m fadein>Shortly after, the troops from the Elf Village arrived to clean everything up.
*
<w2><m fadein>The medic told me that Ixia was in something called "Hypomanaemic Shock" and that’s why she fainted.
*
<w2><m fadein>Thankfully, they said she’d be able to make a full recovery and took her to a medical facility in Grazia for treatment.
*
<w2><m fadein>Hearing that was a huge relief. 
My friend is safe, and that’s all that matters.

// 絵はver0.22aでは用意できないだろうな～

*g_03
Yep, this is the monster we’ve been hunting. It matches the descriptions in the reports we’ve been getting.
*
Did you take it down all by yourself?

*n_04
No, not at all... It’s all thanks to your unit weakening it and backing it into a corner.
*
And...to Ixia for the spell she gave me.

*g_05
Well, regardless, it’s our fault you and your friend got dragged into this. 
*
We got careless when the monster was wounded and that allowed it to escape.
*
My entire unit is indebted to you. We’ll find a way to repay you someday.

*n_06
Oh, you don’t have to do that...It’s my fault for not listening to the evacuation order in the first place...
*
I should be the one apologizing to you...

*g_07
Heheh. If you were one of my subordinates, I’d already have you writing an apology letter.
*
At least it all got settled peacefully in the end. 
*g_07b
Be proud of yourself, young lady.

*n_08
...Thank you.

*g_09
Mind telling me your name again? Our transmission was cutting out, so I didn’t catch it.

*n_10
I am Noel Cornehl. 
Class III Cadet at Bermit Academy.

*g_11
I see. Once again, 
I'm Mepha Gridyard, Commanding Officer of the Elf Village's Monster Suppression unit.
*g_11b
Grazia is outside my unit’s jurisdiction, but perhaps we’ll meet again someday.

*n_12
<think>Well...it’s not like I can visit her in the village...being a Cornehl and all...

*g_12
...So, you’re a student from Grazia, huh?
*
Do they teach you youngsters how to take down these monsters as part of your curriculum?

*n_13
Eh? Ah...
*n_13b
<I><m ple>OH NO!!!
I forgot I was on my way to school! I'm going to be late!
*
S-Sorry, I have to go now──!


// ノエル去る
*g_14
...My oh my. 
*
Don’t worry Noel Cornehl, those Grazians aren’t such a rigid lot; They won’t scold you for being late. Especially given the situation.
*g_14b
What an interesting girl.
