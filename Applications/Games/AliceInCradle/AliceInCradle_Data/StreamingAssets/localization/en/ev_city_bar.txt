*w_01
Y'know, this prob'ly ain't the right place for someone like you. <m joy>You might get attacked by a drunken wolf in elf's clothing.

*n_02
I have a feeling you're right...
*
Were you fighting with someone just now?

*w_03
Ah, y'heard that?
Yeah, I get a bit rowdy when I'm drinkin'...

// 酒場　========================


*___city/bar_w_t_bar w_00 
I always stop by this place when I come down from the mountain. They've got a damn fine selection of drinks.
*w_00_2
Especially "Heat Shot 197", I can't get enough of it.

*w_01
Grazia's not a city I'm comfortable in, t'be honest...
*w_02
But, the bartender here is a beastman, so that helps put me at ease.

*n_03
<think>The bartender is a...beastman?


// ケンカについて

*___city/bar_w_t_fight w_00 
That elf soldier guy was picking a fight with my friend.
*
'Said his dad died in the line of duty.
*
He claimed a beastman would never understand such loss because we can reincarnate.
*
Made it seem like we've never lived or done an honest day's work in our lives.

*n_01
The beastmen are doing so much for this city and our people...
I've seen it with my own eyes.
*n_02
My father is also very prejudiced against beastmen...
It makes me feel ashamed...

*w_03
That's pretty normal these days. Don't let it get to ya.


// 昔話 ========================
*___city/bar_w_t_forklore w_00
This was a long time ago, but...
*w_01
We were working up in the mountains, and one of our guys pulled the pin on some explosives, but his foot got caught on something.
*
I was just a kid, so seein' him get blown up was so horrifying I couldn't sleep fer days.
*
But then next week, he showed up to work fine and dandy.
*
Funny how lighthearted our lives can be, ain't it?

*n_01
...

*w_02
That's the part where yer s'posta laugh, lass.
*w_03
Sorry fer puttin' such a bad image in that pretty l'il head a' yers.
<m scary>Gahaha!

<i><c0>Beastmen shall serve elves and labor under them eternally with their immortal lives.

Sigh, being ordered around all the time pisses me off. Still, I do love this life.

*n_01
I know that when a beastman reaches the end of their life, they go to a facility for reincarnation.

*w_02
Right you are. There's a ridiculously white one here in town. I always go to the one in the mountains, but...

*w_03
Say, lass, do you think beastmen are despicable?

*n_04
Of course not...

*n_05
I mean, other elves...
Some of their opinions are...

*w_06
Ahh, I wasn't tryin' t'complain about elves. Fergit I said anything.
*w_07
I've been told that when I was a little brat, I used to go on rants about how we were nothing more than replaceable tools.
*w_08
I don't even remember that. It's just a dusty memory buried deep in my ID Data.

*n_09
I thought beastmen remembered everything clearly starting from birth.

*w_10
No way that's true, since I can't even remember the face of the guy I got in a fight with moments ago.
<m scary>Gahaha!

*w_11
I mostly just remember my family, friends, th' stuff I need for work, and where to get a good drink.
*
I'm grateful to have a youthful body that can handle everyday demands.

Oh, hey there. Thanks again for your help earlier.

You're welcome. Do you know what that fight was about with Walross?

I just stepped in without thinking while I was wandering around town.
*s_02
That's good.
*s_02_2
<m scary>N-not that this is a bad place to be or anything...<m>
*
It's just that you seem like such a nice girl, but if you were actually the type to hang out at bars with roughnecks...
*
<m fadein>My mental image of elves would get even more weird and I wouldn't know what to think...

I noticed you checking out the 4-Ascend table. Are you interested?
*n_01
Oh, um...yes, but...
*
I usually play with my friends and teachers. Playing here with someone I barely know feels weird...
*n_02
Is 4-Ascend played up in the mountains?
*s_03
Yes, but mostly by children.
*s_04
The one here seems to be an older version with different rules than what I'm used to. I'm not sure how good I'd be.
*s_05
But, I could use a break from drinking with Walross. You up for a game?

// ノエルが勝った

Well, it wouldn't have been possible without you.
