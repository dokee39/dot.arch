I wonder where they took Ixia? Hope I can find her before class starts...

*n_03
I could try asking one of them...

// 服が汚れている場合

<m fadein>...but, I should really clean myself up first. The customs building should have a shower I can use before I go into town.

*n_05
<m fadein>...but, I'm in no condition to talk with anyone right now.

It might be a bit messy, but I'll have to make do with the shower in the customs building by the barrier.

You there! Can you spare a minute?

*mb_02
You're a student here, right? I'm with the Grazia Times.
*
I'm doing a report on the large monster and the mobilization of our military. May I ask you a few questions?

*n_03
Ah...m-my teacher told me never to get involved with such things...


//わざと聞いてないふり
*mb_04
I'm told this monster has appeared before.
*
And the army has engaged it several times. Is this true?

*n_05
Uuu...

*mb_06
The call to mobilize seemed more urgent this time. We picked up a signal that made it sound like someone was in danger.
*
However, only the vanguard was deployed, while the middle guard teams were disbanded. Is this also true?


*n_07
I...I don't know...


*mb_08
Really? This leads us to believe that the monster is finally gone for good.
*
But, did it die of natural causes, or did someone else put the nail in its coffin?
*mb_09
Someone had to have been there. On the way over, I heard these strange sounds-

Hey, you hear about the girl who got hurt during the monster's attack?

*mb_01
No, that's news to me.

*mc_02
Yeah, that's 'cuz the teachers are tryin' to keep it under wraps.

*mb_03
How come?

*mc_04
How should I know?
*
Anyway, one of the students saw a teacher go into the forest after the incident, towards the witch house.

*mb_06
That place out past the giant acid tree?
*
I've never been there, but I've heard a lot of rumors about what goes on...

*ma_07
Yeah, same. I even heard that her daughter is a cadet here.
*
And she's the one that got injured and can't come to school anymore.

*mc_08
Ah, I've got it!

*mb_09
Got what?

*mc_09
I thought it was super weird for monsters to attack in such large numbers just out of the blue.
*
That girl...she must've summoned them and led the attack!

*ma_09
Whaaaaaat!?

*mc_10
And then she had them attack her to cover her tracks!
*
What do you think? That's gotta be it!

*ma_11
Ehhh, no way.
*
But, there is something freaky about that witch house...
*
When I was a kid, my mom would tell me the witch would come after me and turn me into a doll if I misbehaved.

Ah, hello, Noel. Good to see you.

How's Ixia doing?

*n_04
Sorry to interrupt, Miss Primula. How's Ixia doing?

*p_05
Good to see you, Noel.


// ここで合流
*p_06
I've just finished the mana restoration procedure. It was touch and go for a bit, but she's alright.

*n_06
Thank goodness.

*p_07
I'm a bit more worried about the hits her body sustained. Let's check on her.


// ノエル、イクシャの方を見る。一瞬の間

It's odd seeing her like this instead of her usual lively self, isn't it?

*n_09
<m fadein>Yes indeed, <W2>heehee.


//布団がもぞもぞする

*i_10
I'm awake, y'know.

*n_11
<m ple>Ah, Ixia!
<W2>You're supposed to be resting.

*i_11
Tch, you're not a doctor. Besides, I feel fi-

*i_12
// 勢いよく起き上がる。ダメージ音（ゲーム中そのままのやつ。
<I><m scary><big>AH! OWWWW!!!

*p_12
While I appreciate your eagerness, Ixia, you do need to rest.
*
The recovery magic should kick in soon to help with the pain.

*i_13
<m fadein>...okay.

*p_14
Once the pain subsides, I'll escort you to your afternoon classes.
*p_15
Thank you for visiting, Noel.
Leave the rest to me.
*
You should get going. Class is about to start.

*n_15
<m ple>Yes, ma'am!


// 制服

*105/health_ixia_t_uniform i_00
...What? That big guy got my uniform all sticky and I don't have anything else to wear.

*i_01
It's supposed to be cleaned and dried in time for the practical test this afternoon.
*
So don't go celebrating early, thinking you've won by default, Noel Cornehl!

*p_02
It's great that you're in high spirits, Ixia, but if the pain returns, come see me immediately.

*n_03
Take care, Ixia...

*i_04
Hmph!


// 回復魔術


*105/health_ixia_t_curemagic i_00
I can't believe you had to save me twice today. I don't usually mess up this bad...
*
If I knew how to use recovery magic, I could've at least undone the damage from the molesnake. Then maybe-

*p_02
Recovery magic is for medical personnel only.
*
There's a limit to the amount of times an elf can recieve it each year. Plus there's the issue of abusing it...

*i_04
Yeah, I know, I know!


// 暇じゃない?
*105/health_ixia_t_boring i_00
Huh? Well, I definitely can't sleep after everything that's happened.

*i_01
And as much as I'd rather go to class, I don't mind staring at the ceiling a little while longer.

*n_02
I see.

*n_03
Miss Primula, do we still have a 4-Ascend game in here?

*p_04
Yes, but class is about to start.

*n_05
<m ple>W-well, you see...
<m0>I'm not feeling so good, and that might make me a little late to class.

*p_06
Sigh...Shasta always tried to get me to play with her when she was in the infirmary too...

*i_07
So, you're going to skip class to play games with me because you think I'm bored?
*
I don't need your charity, Noel Cornehl!

*i_08
But if I back down now, it'd look like I'm running away from your challenge...

*i_09
So I guess I have no choice but to play with you.


*105/health_ixia_t_ttr i_00
<m ple>I'm gonna beat you to a pulp!


// イクシャに勝った!
*105/health_ixia_ttr_result i_000

*i_010
You can't just win and leave! You have to give me a chance to catch back up!


// イクシャに負けた
*i_100
What's wrong, Noel Cornehl? Did you lose your edge while you were out?

*n_101
Uuu, maybe I'm not in the best shape today...

*i_110
You're so careless! Now I can see how the monsters keep catching you off-guard!

*n_111
<think>You're the last person I want to hear that from!


// 先生との雑談

*105/health_primula_t_road2city p_00
Did anything happen on your way to town? I hope you didn't get caught up in another battle.

*n_01
Eh? No...everything was fine. Thanks for your concern.

*p_02
Of course. You're still recovering, after all. Remember to take things slowly.

*n_03
I will. It's thanks to you and Ixia that I'm doing so well now.

*p_03
...speaking of things going well, it sounds like the army did a fine job with that big monster.
*
The reports said it was quickly approaching the barrier and posed a serious threat.

*p_04
I'm glad the army was able to defeat it before it could cause any damage to Grazia.

*n_04
But...the army didn't-

*p_05
Hmm?

*n_06
<think>Ohh, that's right. I disobeyed the order to retreat and engaged the monster on my own.
*
<think>Bermit Academy is part of the military. I could be severely punished if they found out.
*
<think>That blue-haired commander lady must have reported the monster's defeat as her own unit's doing.

*p_07
Noel, you're making a face...
What's wrong?

*n_08
Oh, n-nothing. I was just thinking about how scary it would have been if that monster attacked me.


//プリムラ先生と対局

*105/health_primula_t_ttr n_00
I haven't played against you in awhile. Come on, let's go!

*p_01
Hmm, this is something I brought from home to help the more mischievous students pass the time.
*
I don't really want this to be something the infirmary is used for...

*p_02
...but, what the hey. I'll just be glad for the opportunity to play with you again.

While you were recovering at home, a girl named Alma kept asking me how you were doing.

*n_01
Alma?

// 駅でアルマに会っていない
*n_02
<think>Alma Opfebaum...she's in my class. During the attack two weeks ago, I-

*p_03
She's probably waiting for you in 1-2 in the west wing. Why don't you go see her?

*n_04
Okay. I'll let her know that I'm fine.

// 駅でアルマに会っている
*p_10
I saw her this morning, too. She said she spoke with you at the station and seemed very excited to start practicing today.

*p_11
I think she's outside on the grounds right now.

I see. I'll go thank her again for caring about me.

I just...need to practice more than everyone else...that's all.

*n_04
It's more admirable than you think.

Even I make up excuses sometimes like "I'm tired", or "I'm hungry" to avoid practice.

*l_05

...and that's why-... Is everyone paying attention?
This is important, so I'll go over it again.
*
<I><W2>Monsters are unique beings whose bodies are composed of magic.
*
<I><W2>The term "monster" is generic, and used to describe a variety of magical creatures these days.
*
<I><W2>The historical reason we call them monsters comes from Grazian scriptures-
*
<I><W2>-which originally described them as "reddish-black monsters emerging from the sea".
*
<I><W2>The most widely accepted theory is that all modern-day monsters descended from them.
*
<I><W2>However, this is only a comparitive cultural interpretation-

*105/main_classroom tc_00_2
-and what really differentiates monsters from one another is the nature of the magic that makes up their bodies.
*
<I><W2>Compared to elves and beastmen, the magic in a monster's body is highly unstable.
*
<I><W2>As a result, their lifespans are generally quite short.
*
<I><W2>However-
*
<I><W6>-this short lifespan is accompanied by a rapid evolutionary pace.
*
<I><W2>This allows them to adapt to new environments within just a few generations.
*
<I><W2>Therefore-

*tc_04
For a long time now, monsters were thought to be simple-minded creatures.
*
<I><W2>However, it's been recently discovered that some of them are using magic similar to ours.
*
<I><W2>The most surprising of which, is the ability to use electricity-based magic.
*
<I><W2>I'm sure you've all heard the recent reports about certain monsters capable of firing powerful bolts of lightning.
*
<I><W2>They convert mana into electrical energy, then release it in a sudden, channeled burst.
*
<I><W2>In our society, only those with a Class V license are permitted to practice such dangerous magic.
*
<I><W2>Although the mechanics are quite simple, our research shows that the monsters are only using a crude imitation of what we have, but-
*
<I><W2>-the fact that they are able to replicate it at even a basic level is still a significant find.


*tc_05
<W4>This intelligence along with their propensity to hunt elves in groups-
*
<I><W2>-has some researchers claiming that their evolution is being guided by outside forces.
*
<I><W2>A lot of newspapers and magazines are publishing sensational articles about this idea.
*
<I><W2>So far it's nothing more than a ridiculous conspiracy theory...
*
<I><W2>...but, strangely, our research is producing results that support this theory.
