<think>There's a combination lock on the door.

*n_01
<think>Even if I knew the combination, I shouldn't be doing this without permission...

Welcome.
*
I am unable to meet with you in person as I am busy tending the bar.

// バーで粗相をした

*n_00
<m fadein>Sorry for giving you extra work with the mess I made...

*bt_01
Hm? Oh, don't worry about that. You didn't do anything wrong.

*n_01
But...
<m fadein>...uuu.

*n_02
<think><m fadein>I never thought I'd see the day when a monster would try to comfort me...

// => bt_03

// バーで粗相をしてない
*bt_02
Tell me, who gave you the combination to the lock?
*
Did the Great Tree send you a divine message? Or, did you just guess at it?

// => bt_03

*bt_03
Glad to see you here, at any rate. Let us toast to our meeting.
*
I can't offer you any actihol right now, but I can offer you a deal.

*n_04
Umm...what kind of deal?

*bt_05
There's a special bottle down in that storeroom. What do you suppose would happen if you drank from it?

*bt_06
I'll tell you...
<m joy>You would gain otherworldly insight<m>.
*
You'd be able to see to the other side, and rewrite the rules of reality.

I'll tell you...<font color="ff:#000000">You'll unlock new options in the "Settings" menu.<b>
*
<font color="ff:#000000">I would like to help you reach the optimal "Kawaisou is kawaii" levels you desire.


*n_07
I'm not sure I understand...
Are you talking about making the effects of actihol stronger?

*bt_08
Sorry, that was a bit abstract...
*
Use<key add/>to think back on what I said, and I'm sure the meaning will be clear.

*n_09
Okay. So, how much do I have to pay for this?

*bt_10
I'm sure you're well aware there's something we monsters value much more than money.
*
<c5>Your body fluids<c0>.
Ingesting the mana contained within is a source of great pleasure for us.

*n_11
<m fadein>Uuu...I had a hunch it would be something like this...

*bt_12
Of course, I'd be happy with anything that came from your body, not just fluids.

<font color="ff:#000000">I will accept Noel Juice, Noel Milk, and Noel Eggs.

*bt_13
The barrel beneath this speaker should work to store your products. Place them in when you want to trade.

*n_14
P-product...

*bt_14
Here's what I have available. I hope there's something to your liking.

// 2回目以降
*bt_20
So glad to see you again. Let's trade.

Oh? How long has that been there? Looks like it depicts a girl with pink hair.
*
Probably just a doodle someone made.
