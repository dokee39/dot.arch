Are you a student at the academy?

Everyone's still on edge from the attack. You should get goin' before you get yelled at.

Um, excuse me, do you know where they took the elf that got injured?

Hmm, can't say that I do. I only just got back.

I'd heard about an elf that got rescued, but I don't know anything beyond that.

The guards closer to the center of town might know something. Check with them.

The forest is under the jurisdiction of the elf city, but the battle took place closer to here.
*
If something is a threat to the barrier, we're supposed to take action.
*
But if we screw up, it shows up on their records, not ours. They'd tear us a new one for tarnishing their reputation.
*
We were mostly trying to figure out if we should even make a move.

Thank you.

*mb_05
We've got some bloodthirsty soldiers here, but I'd prefer there not be any battles so close to the city where we'd need them.

This barrier wouldn't stop a monster as big as the one we just had. Wish I could soup it up.

Still, we do rely on it to protect everyone.

The Lord of the Forest is defeated! 
A silver whirlwind has restored peace!

【Breaking News】
Today, the legendary Lord of the Forest has been 
brought down by a mighty warrior! This monster waged war with 
Grazia for hundreds of years and showed no sign of stopping.
Over the years, it has destroyed countless villages and dragged 
unwary adventurers to their doom. But now, the nightmare is 
finally over. In the throes of death, its roar shook the forest, 
heralding the end. This feat by our hero in white is proof that 
we can triumph over even the most violent forces of nature.

One of the valves on the line above us blew out and started gushing water below.
*
The beastman working there got hit and fell all the way down.
*
At least it was only a beastman. If it had been an elf...
*
...not that our deaths are meaningless.
*
He ended up losing ten days of wages, and his wife really tore into him.
*
They say if you play with fire, you'll get burned. But this time, it was water.

//Can I Offer You a Nice Egg In This Trying Time?

*___city/slam_egg_seller mb_00
Hello, Miss...
Care for a nice egg?
*
I gathered up all the best ones I could find.
*
Oh, no, they're not mine. They came from animals up in the mountains.
...mostly.


// 買わなかった

*mb_01
Ehehe...
Come back soon!


// 買った

*mb_02
Ehehe...
Thank you very much!


// 全て買った

*mb_03
Ah! All sold out!
Diaz is gonna eat well tonight.
*
Hehe...Ehehe...
Hope to see you again real soon!


// 完売後、再度話す

*mb_04
Ehehe...
Thank you so much, Miss!
*
I'll do my best to produce even more eggs for next time.
I mean, gather even more eggs...

I admire how hard my sister always works.
*
I wanna help collect eggs too! But, she never takes me with her...
*
The roads are full of monsters and other dangers, so I understand.
*
I've even heard rumors of ghosts appearing.

*mb_01
Sister says the best way to get good eggs and juice is by spreading "<i>that stuff</i>" outside to raise the danger level and luring in monsters.
*
I understand what the danger level is on the mana-meter...but what's "<i>that stuff</i>"?
*
She also told me I'm too young to know about Diaz...

Do you know about the "Orbital Shield" skill?
*
I heard there was some kind of <c5>update<c0> that made it much stronger.
*
You can use magic alongside it, making it super versitile.
*
But it's pretty tricky...
I used it at the wrong time once and gave the monsters the only opportunity they needed...

If you want to take on a horde of monsters, you should eat some meat.
*
Meat and fish will increase your offensive power, both magical and physical.
*
And your shotgun ability benefits from both of those increases!

Can I share something with you? Only...you have to promise not to tell anyone, especially my mom!
*
I was exploring outside of town when I...had to go potty...
*
There weren't any bathrooms nearby so I went in the grass...
*
And suddenly my mana-meter started going off!
*
It scared me and I accidentally got some on my underpants...

*mb_01
My mom told me not to go potty outside because it attracts monsters.
*
What if...there were monsters here in Grazia disguised as beastmen?
*
If we went in front of them, would they be able to resist showing themselves?
*
Ahh, what am I saying? I just really don't want to go home...

Hey, wanna see a cool photo?

*n_01
Where was this taken?

*mb_02
I'm not sure...I just found it on the ground up in the mountains.
*
The colors are prettier than ones taken with a staff...

*n_03
You're right...it almost feels like it's more than just a picture...

*mb_04
I wanna see if I can find it, but my mom said the forest is too dangerous right now.
*
I know! Why don't I give it to you?

My tutor told me about a shrine near the drawbridge that looked like this.
*
Do you think that might be it?


*__treasurehunt/000_1 n_00
A tiny chest? What's inside?

*n_01
Some money and...another picture?

*n_02
Why do I feel like someone is making me play "fetch"...?

*__treasurehunt/000_5 n_00
This picture isn't from the forest.

*n_01
But then, where...?
*n_02
Maybe it's <c5>someplace I can't get to yet</c5>...
