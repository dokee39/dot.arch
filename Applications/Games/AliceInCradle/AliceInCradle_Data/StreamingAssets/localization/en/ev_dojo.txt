<I><angry/><m scary><big>HERETIC!!!!

*n_01
!?

*dj_02
Ahem, excuse me.
Welcome to Fiolet Dojo, a place to train your body, hone your skills, and refine your tactics.
*
No need to explain why you're here. I can see it in your eyes...

*dj_03
<I><m scary>You're a dojo stormer, aren't you!?

*n_04
Eh, no. I was just curious about the statues outside...

*dj_05
Don't be so modest.
*
Your glorious thighs alone could take us all on. They're like the border between life and death.

*dj_06
And just beyond that border lies the White Triangle, protector of the holy land.
*
Ah, it's as if the angel Fiolet has returned to us.

*n_07
<I><angry>H-Hey, stop that!!

*dj_08
Sorry. I am the assistant instructor of this dojo.
*
Have you been learning new "skills" properly?

*n_09
Um...I've learned new skills from the talismans I've been given. Some of them I found myse-

*dj_10
<I><angry/><m scary><big>HERETIIIIIIC!!!!

*n_11
<m ple>WAH!

*dj_12
<angry/><m scary>Skills are supposed to be passed down from master to apprentice, father to son, generation after generation!
*
These days everyone talks about how easy it is to just attach an extension to their staff.

*dj_14
<I><angry/><m scary><big>They're all heretics!!!

*n_15
...

*dj_16
Ahem, excuse me.
*
This dojo is a place for you to acquire skills available to you the proper way.
*
There is a fee for training with us. We're not a charity, you know.

*st_18
In other words, if you've missed some skills in your adventures, you can buy them here.

*dj_19
Well, in layman's terms, yes, that's how it works. If you want to train for reasons other than learning skills, we welcome that as well.

*dj_20
Come on, you youngsters!! Improve your skills with us and rise to new heights!!

*___dojo/v_talk_statue dj_00
That is Fiolet, angel of war. We designed our uniforms to be similar to hers.
*
<c black><i>"Born from the sacred tree, of mixed blood between an angel and a human; she overcame many hardships and guides us all."
*
...so the legend goes.

*n_01
<think>Rather generic sounding legend...

*dj_02
<c black><i>"When the White Triangle peeks out from beneath her robes, those who gaze upon it are blessed with good fortune."</c></i>
*
That's a very well-known passage.
*n_03
<think>This guy just likes to stare at panties...

*dj_04
I polish it every day so the White Triangle will shine more brightly on this dojo.
*
You are welcome to touch it and receive its blessings.
*n_05
<think>Gross...

// ======

*___dojo/v_talk_cap n_00
Um, about what's on your head...

*dj_01
It is the symbol of our dojo. Modeled after the White Triangle that protects Fiolet's buttocks.
*
It is also proof of our belief that training one's mind, body, and skills is the true way forward.

*n_02
...but they're pan-...they're ladies underwear.

*dj_03
Well, yeah, if you look at it as nothing more than a piece of cloth...

*n_04
<I><m ple>That's exactly what it is!




*___dojo/mob1 st_00
Sorry about all the tension. We spent most of our budget on those three stone statues, and we're barely scraping by.
*
Is she really a famous angel? I don't read many books, so I have no idea.

*st_01
Oh, by the way...
*
I know our master said <m scary>"Using a staff to attach and remove skills is outrageous!"</m>,
or something like that.
*
But, any skill you learn here will be registered to your staff...
*
You can just remove it later, like any other skill.


*___dojo/mob2 st_00
It's popular for people these days to set up elaborate puzzles with magic and treasure chests in hidden spots out in the forest.
*
But, I can't figure out how to solve them no matter how hard I try.
*
Plus my timing sucks...
*
I almost got crushed by a closing gate the other day...
*
I'm really grateful I can learn skills here instead.


*st_01
Having trouble winning against our master?
*
He's a pretty straightforward guy. You should be able to read which of his moves is coming next.
*
Of course, if you try to move first, you'll always lose...
*
Listen carefully to his shouts and memorize the timing.

// ========================================================
// MARK : ___dojo/v_talk_study_error_bgm
// ========================================================
*___dojo/v_talk_study_error_bgm dj_00
Hmm...you have your BGM volume set to 0.
*
There's a rhythm involved in <i>Fiolet-fist</i> training, and listening to a beat helps with that.
*
We can proceed as-is, but you'll be making things more difficult for yourself. Are you okay with that?


// ========================================================
// MARK : ___dojo/v_talk_study_first
// ========================================================




*___dojo/v_talk_study_first dj_00
Before we begin, you'll need to change into your training clothes.
*
Spare uniforms are back in the changing room. Find one that fits you and come back when you're ready.

*n_00
Hmm...I suppose this one will do.
*
What should I do with the underwear?

*dj_01
? Those are for you to wear.
*
Don't worry, we clean and inspect them every day. They're as pure and white as Fiolet's.

*n_01
Huh? These are part of the uniform!?

*dj_02
Yes. Please respect the sacred rules of our dojo and train in the uniform we have provided for you.

*n_02
O-okay.


*n_03
I'm not so sure about this...
*
<I><m ple>Why is it so short!? It won't cover anything once I start moving around...

*dj_04
That is the proper attire of our dojo. If you look at the statue of Fiolet, you'll see that it's the same as her's.

*n_05
But, I...
Uuu...alright...

*
<think>There's no clasps or anything to keep the front closed. This isn't suitable for martial arts training at all.
*
<think>It's okay, just push those thoughts out of your head. This is a legitimate place of training, after all...
*
<think>Sigh, this is so embarrassing.

// 二回目以降



*dj_20
Change into your training clothes and let's begin.

// 着てくる
*n_21
Uuu...

*dj_22
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

*n_23
Umm...no. It's just...
*
C-could I wear some shorts underneath my robe?

*dj_24
...why?

*n_25
W-well, if I train like this, people will be able to see my <W2><m fadein>pa...underwear...
*
<m fadein>So, I thought it might be better to have-

*dj_26
<m scary>You got a problem with our sacred uniform!?
*n_27
<I><m ple>Ahh, no! It was just a thought!

*dj_28
Ahem, alright then. Let's begin.

*n_29
<think><m fadein>Uuuuuu...

// ========================================================
// MARK : 準備体操
// ========================================================

*___dojo/mg__portal dj_01
Let's get warmed up first!


*___dojo/mg_tuto dj_01
<c1>Fiolet-fist<c0> is a martial arts style that uses three different techniques to subdue opponents.

*
We shall practice each technique until you know them like the back of your hand.
*
No matter which technique you use, your timing is the most important thing of all!
*
The first technique.
<c1>Unbreakable Boulder<c0>! Let the enemy's sword shatter upon you!


*djt_tuto_good
<I>Good!


*djt_tuto_bad_wrong
<I>Wrong!

*djt_tuto_bad_fast
<I>Too soon!
*djt_tuto_bad_slow
<I>Too slow!


*dj_02
Come on, you can do better!
Channel your fighting spirit into your fist!
*
The second technique.
<c4>Impaling Bident<c0>! Pierce through your enemy's defenses!


*dj_03
Keep it up!
See things through to the end!
*
The third technique.
<c5>Crushing Wave<c0>! Surround your enemy and crush them with overwhelming force!


*dj_04
Alright! Looks like you've got the technique and the timing down.
*
Each technique has a weakness
<rb c="Rock"><c1>Boulder<c0></rb> beats <rb c="Scissors"><c4>Bident<c0></rb>.
<rb c="Scissors"><c4>Bident<c0></rb> beats <rb c="Paper"><c5>Wave<c0></rb>.
<rb c="Paper"><c5>Wave<c0></rb> beats <rb c="Rock"><c1>Boulder<c0></rb>.
*
Now, I'm going to perform the <rb c="Scissors"><c4>Bident<c0></rb> technique.
Perform the technique that will defeat me.

*dj_05
Of course, in reality, knowing your opponent's next move won't be so easy.
*
Pay attention and choose the right technique with good timing. This is the key to mastering Fiolet-fist!
*
Now, let's practice a bit in a manner closer to actual training. Don't let your guard down!


*dj_10
Well done!
*
You're quite skilled! I look forward to seeing you in actual training.
*
If you choose the same technique as your opponent 3 times, or the wrong technique, you will lose one hitpoint.
*
Training will end prematurely if your health reaches 0. Don't get careless.


*___dojo/mg_loseb dj_00
<I><m ple>BAAAAAAAD!!!

*n_00
<I><m ple>Waah!?


*dj_01_fast
<I><m ple>Don't be so hasty! If you move first, your opponent will know exactly how to counter!

*dj_01_slow
<I><m ple>Too slow! Your opponent already made a move before you even considered a countermeasure!


*dj_01
<I><m ple>You're wide open!

// ================================================
// チュートリアルでの進行
*dj_tuto00 
<I><m ple>If this were a real session, you'd have taken a hit.

*dj_tuto01
Pay attention to your opponent's technique, and choose the right counterattack with good timing.
*
If you act too quickly or too slowly, your opponent will get in easily and you'll lose a hitpoint.
*
Choosing the same technique as your opponent 3 times, or the wrong technique, will also result in a loss of a hitpoint.
*
Training will end prematurely if your health reaches 0. Don't get careless.

*mg_loseb_rk0 dj_00
Since this is just a training session, I'll only subject you to the gusts created by my iron fist.

*n_00
<think>Uwah! My uniform...!
*
I'm sorry, Master!
Please, let's continue our training.
*
I just need to fix my uniform fir-

*dj_01
<I><m scary>You're sloppy!</m>
*
<I>Your disorderly uniform is a reflection of your mind! No wonder your technique is so weak!

*n_02
<think>Uuu...it's not my fault the uniform is too short...

// =======
// グーに負けた 2回目
*mg_loseb_rk1 dj_01
The White Triangle that protects you is not just for show.
*
It is a sacred garment, mimicking the one of Lady Fiolet.
*
But, yours are in disarray. Tighten the belt on your fighting spirit! Take this seriously!

*n_01 
Please stop staring at my panti-...my underwear!

// ================================================
// チョキに負けた 1回目
*mg_loseb_sc0 dj_00
Be thankful these didn't pierce your innards. Always observe your opponent carefully.

*n_00
S-stop pinching me...!

*dj_01
The only thing I want to hear from you is "Let's continue our training".

*n_02
Uu...
L-let's...continue training...

*dj_03
<I><m scary>Say it with conviction! Where's your fighting spirit?!

*n_04
I want to continue training!
T-take your hand off...

*dj_05
Alright. Don't let your guard down!

// ================================================
// チョキに負けた 2回目
*mg_loseb_sc1 n_01
<think>Hyah...! My nipple...

*dj_06
Is this really your best effort?! Steel yourself and let's try again!

*n_07
<think>Guh...
He's doing this on purpose...


// ================================================
// パーに負けた 1回目
*mg_loseb_pa0 dj_00
The Unbreakable Boulder technique is powerful, but it is not without weakness.
*
You need to watch out for for attacks from behind.

*n_00
S-stop groping me!

*dj_01
No back talk! This is training to focus your mind and technique!
*
If you understand, you know what you need to say for us to resume training.
*n_02
Uuu...
Let's continue our training.

*dj_03 
Good!
Back into position!

// ================================================

// パーに負けた 2回目
*mg_loseb_pa1 dj_01
If you're always on the offensive, it'll be easier for your opponent to catch you by surprise!

*n_03
U-understood!
*
But...what's the point of groping here?!

*dj_04
This mimics an attack used by monsters. If you don't want your mana drained, you need to train with a stronger fighting spirit!

*n_05
<think>Pervert!

// ================================================
// 後出しまたは早出し 1回目
*mg_loseb_slowfast0 n_00
...!?
M-my underwear...!?

*dj_00
For acting so recklessly, I've confiscated your <rb c="bra">White Garment</rb>.
*
Don't worry. It will be returned to you after we're done training.
*
Pupil.
Put this aside for now.

// 生徒
*st_01
Yes.

*n_02
N-no way...


// ================================================
// 後出しまたは早出し 2回目
*mg_loseb_slowfast1 n_00
Wa-wa-wa-waiiit!! You can't take those!!

*dj_00
Have you forgotten? This is the second time you've acted without thinking!
*
You've disrespected this training session, this dojo, and the angel Fiolet!
*
The White Triangle weeps at your shameful act!
*n_01
I'm sorryyyyy! I'll do it right next time! So please, give them back-

*dj_02
This is your last warning!
On your guard!

// ================================================

<m scary>Uuu<W2>...!
<m fadein>Ah...
*
<m ple>No...<m fadein><W2>please...!
<m fadein><W2>No more...!

*dj_00
That's enough!
*
My fighting spirit has decimated your uniform. I thank Lady Fiolet for her blessings today.
*
Let us rest for a time. Go to the changing room and find another uniform.
*
When you come back, we'll see if we can work your technique into something sturdier.

*n_01
<think>Couldn't I just have some sturdier clothes?!
