...?
*ow_00
<m scary>Welcome...
to the Horus Museum...

*n_01
<angry><m pla>Hya!?

*ow_01
Admission...
*
...is <img mesh="money_icon" width="18" />90000...

// 払う／払わない／払えない

*ow_100
I was just kidding.
That'd be way too much for this dump.

// ここから分岐 払う ========================
*ow_101
...were seriously going to pay?
*
Heh...wow. What's it like to never want for anything?

// 払えない ========================
*n_102
I think it looks okay...

// 払わない ========================
*ow_102
I know it's obvious I was joking, but could you have at least played along a little?
*
Ah, forget it. The only real joke here is the museum itself.

*n_103
Oh, um...
I'm sorry?

// 合流 ========================


*n_02
Is everything okay?
All the black smoke I saw outside made me think there was a fire...

*n_03
<I><angry>...but it looks like
<m ple>it's coming from that crystal ball!?

*ow_03
That's the centerpiece of the museum. Well, really the
only installation...
The "Eye of Truth".

*ow_04
Sigh...
*
I was born in Grazia, 400 years ago...
*
I've always been too slow, too dumb, and too weak to do anything right.
*
Even when I was doing simple jobs for the city, I managed to screw things up.
*
<I><angry><m scary><S3>I couldn't live like that anymore!!
*
So I decided to make a change and got a loan to rent a building. 
*
Sigh...and of course, I...


*n_05
Wait...so this place really is a museum?

*ow_05
Yes.
*ow_06
I mean, I'd <i>planned</i> to make it into a museum, but...
*
Everyone knows how useless I am.
*
So nobody is willing to trust me with a work of art.
*
Except for this crystal ball...

*ow_07
...but, now I'm thinking I was sweet-talked into buying junk.
*
The elves said it embodies the bearer's spirit or something.
*
What a load of crap. All it does is blast out black smoke. So does a bonfire, but at least that keeps you warm.
*
I can't even tell if a work of art is genuine or not. Just one more job I'm not cut out for...

*n_06
<think>If this crystal really does embody the bearer's spirit...I'd say it's working perfectly.

// 話しかけ直す

*___city_museum/t01 ow_00
Sigh...I give up.
*n_01
<think>The crystal embodies the bearer's spirit...
I wonder what would happen if I touched it?

// 持つ
*___city_museum/t02 ow_00
Hm? Ah.
*
<W1>Yeah, as you can see, all it does is put out black smoke. Still, be careful with-

// 明るくなる
*___city_museum/t03 ow_01
Huh...?

*n_02
Just as I thought.
*
The black smoke was a reflection of all your negative thoughts.

*ow_02
I see...
*
Are you certain that's what it was, Miss Elf?

*n_03
My name is Noel Cornehl. I'm not 100% certain, but-

*ow_03
A crystal ball that manifests one's thoughts...
That could certainly be construed as a valuable work of art.
*
So, were you thinking "This guy sucks. He must be the slowest talker in the world!", or something?

*n_04
<I><m ple>Nonono! Nothing like that!
*
I was thinking about a different beastman altogether!

*ow_05
Don't worry, I'm not offended. I'm used to people feeling that way about me.
*
Hm?


// 絵が出てくる



*n_06
Wah!

*ow_07
That was unexpected. Is that you on the left, Miss Cornehl?
*n_08
Yes, and on the right is...my teacher, Miss Primula.

*n_09
<think>I was thinking about Primula when I touched the crystal. It must've captured one of my memories of her.
*ow_10
This is...wonderful. Simply marvelous.
*ow_11
Elves are normally quite cold towards beastmen, but I can tell the two of you are very close.

*n_12
Oh...th-thank you. It's a little embarrassing to have someone stare into my thoughts like this...

*ow_13
<m scary>Ah! <W1><m>Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude!
*
But...this really is quite amazing.

*ow_14
If you don't mind me asking...
Could I buy this memory from you as a work of art?

*n_13
<m ple>W-what!?
<m>But...how will you-
*ow_15
I have an idea. Give me a moment.

*ow_16
Okay, that should do it.
*
This structure will amplify the light from the crystal and focus it onto the canvas so we can capture it.



*___city_museum/t04 n_17
That's incredible.

*ow_17
Here...
*ow_18
Try picturing the scene in your mind again. When you're ready, press the button to capture it.

*n_18
Okay, here goes-


*n_19
It's a proper work of art!
<W2><small>...where did the frame come from?

*ow_20
Hah...it really worked.
*
I can't thank you enough for this, Miss Cornehl.

*n_21
Oh, it was nothing. The crystal did all the work.

*ow_22
No need to be modest. Here, a token of my appreciation.

*n_23
Uh, this is a lot of money.

*ow_24
Don't worry, I can spare it. I'll just have to cut back on expenses a bit.

*n_24
<think>I don't feel right accepting this...
But it'd be rude to reject his kindness.

*n_25
W-well, I'm sure visitors will come flooding in to see this.

*ow_25
I certainly hope so.
*
Oh, and of course, as the savior of the museum, admission is free for you.
*n_26
"S-Savior" is a bit of an
exaggeration...but...
if you say so...

// 映写機
*___city_museum/t_camera ow_00
We need a name for this contraption. Let's call it the "Soulopticon".
*
I'll keep displaying it as the centerpiece of the museum.
*
I might be getting ahead of myself, but I think we'll be able to make more wonderful memories with people just like you.
*n_01
<think>He's so positive all of the sudden. It's certainly an improvement.

*n_02
If I use it again, do you think it will produce another image?

*ow_01
Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that, not after everything you've already done.
*
...but, if you really want to...
Press the button and we'll see what happens.



// DIY
*___city_museum/t_structure n_00
That thing really is amazing. The way it captures and frames memories...

*ow_00
Ehh, it's no big deal.
*
I just copied the design of something I saw in a book about relics, back when I worked at a library.
*
In all my jobs as a tradesman, civil worker, or day laborer, I've never lasted more than 6 months...
*
So, as someone who has only known failure until now, thank you for all your help.
*n_01
<think>This guy might just be the worst jack-of-all-trades.

// もう一度カメラを握る


*___city_museum/t_newimage_first n_00
<think>If I focus on a different memory, it might generate a new image.
*n_01
<think><m fadein>Let's see...on the way to town, I-
*
<think><m fadein>-saved Ixia, and then...



*___city_museum/t_newimage ow_00
Ohh! A new picture!
*
Please wait while I prepare it...

*ow_01
Thank you as always for your donation.
*
Here is your payment.

// 2階増設
*ow_02
The first floor is feeling a little cramped with so many exhibits.
*
I'll set up another floor. Please wait a moment...

// 性的なイラストが出た
*ow_10
Ah!

*n_11
Um...what's wrong?

*ow_12
Oh, nothing...it's just that, uh...
*
How should I say this...
That last one was of a very <i>sensitive</i> nature.

*n_12
<I>...!

*ow_13
<I><m scary>But, it's okay! I covered it up immediately! Barely even saw anything!

*n_14
<m fadein>Ah...thank you...

*ow_15
We'll keep that one confined to the backroom. You can see it for yourself if you'd like.

// 何も出なかった場合



*___city_museum/t_noimage n_10
...nothing happened.

*ow_11
Are you donating another memory?
*
I can't thank you enough for your kindness. Here's paymen-
*n_12
<m ple>N-no, no! There's no new memory, so please keep your money.
*ow_13
Oh...I see.
*n_14
<think>I need to make more memories for it to capture. I'll come back after I've had more adventures.

This is a memory of my sister taking a guest into "The Break Room" to provide them with a <i>special</i> service.
*ow_01
I've heard rumors about this place. Apparently you can buy all sorts of things there. Aphrodisiac apples, talismans, and the like...
*
The purple smoke coming from that room gives off a frightening aura.
*
I imagine the witch takes the guest in there and does something horrible like eating them.

*n_02
Well, she does sometimes eat <i>something</i> of the guest's...



*___city_museum/cm_pic_pvv010_pn n_00
This is a memory of Primula examining me after I came back from running an errand for my sister.
*ow_00
Beastmen are supposed to labor under the elves and be subservient to them.
*
That ideology is meant to create a society of peace, where elves and beastment coexist.
*
This causes many elves treat beastmen poorly, as if we're nothing more than tools.
*
But, here, I can clearly see the deep bond between the two of you. It is one of respect and trust.
*
In an ideal world, this is how it would be between all beastmen and elves. Living together in harmony at the foot of the great Mother Tree.



*___city_museum/cm_pic_pvv103_ixia ow_00
This must be you bravely charging into battle against a monster. Who's the girl on the right?
*n_01
That's my friend, Ixia. She's quite strong, but she can be careless at times...
*ow_02
I see...
Well, I get the feeling you swooped in and saved her just in the nick of time.
*
How lucky she is to have a friend like you.
*n_02
<think>I don't think I'll tell him that this moment was later than Ixia would've liked for me to arrive.



*___city_museum/cm_pic_pvv104_nusi ow_00
I wasn't expecting so many images to appear at once. I grouped them together so people could see the story they tell.
*
This must be the large monster everyone was talking about recently. Even in picture form, its presence is overwhelming.
*
And the little elf girl it's holding captive must be...
*n_01
Ixia...
The same girl from the previous picture.
*ow_02
I thought so. 
*
This must have been a fierce battle for both of you.

// 超健全以外
*n_02
<think>I wish the puddle reflecting my underwear had been left out. I can't say anything about it, though. It wouldn't be fair to Ixia.
*ow_03
Something wrong, Miss Cornehl?

*n_03
<m fadein>N-no, it's nothing...



*___city_museum/cm_pic_pvv105_alma n_00
This is a memory of when I sat next to Alma during class after being absent for a long time.
*ow_01
Bermit Academy students are called "Cadets". It's for training new Grazian soldiers.
*
Female students mostly take classes for combat. While male students mostly take ones for research and development.
*n_02
That's right. You sure know your stuff.
*ow_03
I worked at Bermit for a short while.
*
I was an advisor for the Magic Handicrafts Club. One time one of the kids needed some of my feathers to make something.
*
But, they ended up plucking a few too many from a rather sensitive area.
*
The sound of all those kids laughing burned into my brain. I had to quit the next day.
*n_04
How awful...

*___city_museum/cm_pic_dojo_intro n_00
This is...from the time I visited the dojo here in Grazia.
*ow_01
I was originally going to put this one in the backroom...
*
But then I got a scathing letter from the assistant instructor saying, "<m scary><c black>There's nothing shameful about our sacred uniforms!<c><m>"
*
So I re-evaluated it, and upon a second viewing, I could feel the tension and dedication of a pupil going through training.
*
...almost even smell the sweat. And the martial arts are an art form themselves, so...
*
This one gives us two perspectives on the wavering resolve of a young elf.
*n_02
I think we could do without the second, perverted perspective...
